<p>O bring me a leaf from the Old Forest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The forest of beauty and song;<br />
Where the Ettrick, through woods and fair meadows,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Doth lead its sweet waters along.</p>
<p>O bring me a leaf from the Old Forest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tuft from the glossy black pine;<br />
A leaf from the oak and high chestnut tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a branch of green holly combine.</p>
<p>O bring me a leaf from the Old Forest,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A token so sacred, O bring;<br />
&rsquo;Twill recall those bright scenes to remembrance,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old friendships around it will
cling.</p>

5</span>PRELUDE.</h2>
<h3>ADDRESSED TO THE CRITIC.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critics of art, connoisseurs of
fair Fame,<br />
Who on her bulwarks stand, to guard the way<br />
Unto the courts wherein her favored dwell,<br />
Where they have gained admittance by the pass<br />
&ldquo;True merit,&rdquo; which alone can bring them there;<br />
Thine is the power the unworthy to debar,<br />
To tell them that they are unfit to come<br />
To seek a standing near her honored throne.<br />
Away in sorrow the beseigers turn,<br />
Foiled in their effort, to more humble scenes,<br />
With showers of censure pouring round them fast,<br />
<!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>And shame in volleys flying on to them.<br />
These are thy missiles, and they lose no mark,<br />
But bear sore torture to the vanquished wretch,<br />
Until oblivion hides him from their power.<br />
Stay they to barter, then the task is vain;<br />
&rsquo;Tis but a weary while they can withstand<br />
The many darts sent with a fatal aim.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I make me bold to speak a word with
thee,<br />
Though better far my tongue had held its peace,<br />
And though my mission be a barren task,<br />
And woe betide me in the course I take.<br />
If ye my motive deem it good to ask,<br />
In form of motto, I will give it thus:<br />
&ldquo;He who doth not to battle venture forth<br />
No trophy takes, as they who go to win.&rdquo;<br />
It is not meet that I should dare to judge<br />
If Merit tend me in the mission here;<br />
But I will trust that Honor may attend,<br />
And that ye will a fair decision give.<br />
I urge no claim to learning high and great,<br />
Nor kinship to the noble in descent,<br />
Nor hold a name to offer of renown;<br />
But from the ranks of secret come, unknown,<br />
And trust in time of fortune to advance,<br />
Then to behold thee in a happy mood.<br />
For men have moods which to their acts imply<br />
<!-- page 7--><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
7</span>An impulse, which doth change the scenes in view<br />
From cheerful unto gloomy, or reverse;<br />
And critics, doubtless, are as other men,<br />
Prone to the changes which incite the throng.</p>
<h3>TO THE SEER.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Time honored Seers, of every age
bestowed<br />
The reverence of man; whose is the power<br />
To scan the future, and draw back the veil,<br />
That people of the present may behold<br />
The scenes and fates which lie secluded there;<br />
To tell strange stories of the time to come,<br />
The kind of life which is awaiting some;<br />
Whereat the heart doth shudder to behold<br />
What it shall be, of revel mirth propelled,<br />
Or bound in joys licentious and wild,<br />
Inoculate with sin of blackest hue,<br />
Verging on crime&mdash;yea, crime in hideous form,<br />
To crown the ruin of this hapless one.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If any of this God-like race remain,<br
/>
Who pry the future with such wondrous skill,<br />
Pass on the pages of this book a glance,<br />
And tell if ye can see upon the time to come,<br />
Aught which is worthy in the art of rhyme;<br />
If from this rugged riplet ye can glean<br />
<!-- page 8--><a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>A flower or two which bear poetic worth;<br />
And if ye see the stream go gliding on<br />
In pleasant ways, through the far distance, spread<br />
On fertile banks, till it at length attain<br />
A fair and undisturb&eacute;d flow, and give<br />
A beauty to the scenes which round it lie,<br />
Or if it ripple for a weary while,<br />
And die at length into a marshy waste,<br />
Give choice to say the former; for the voice<br />
Of him who doth a tiding good convey<br />
Is sweeter far than his which speaketh ill.</p>
<h3>TO THE SAGE.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ye sages, wise and good, or, if
not good,<br />
Though wise, the more thy loss, attend and hear<br />
Awhile, though but a pensive ear ye lend,<br />
If ye will deign to hearken as I speak.<br />
More wont are ye to hear the well-tuned voice<br />
Of classic writer flow in brilliant thought,<br />
Poured from a noble mind, and deep and clear.<br />
Learned of the liberty I take, resolved,<br />
I come thy favor to seduce, and crave<br />
That ye will hearken with a patient heed<br />
Until my story hath been fully told.<br />
Spurn not a man because his years are few,<br />
<!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
9</span>Or that he seems a novice at the first;<br />
But lend a fair and an impartial heed,<br />
Till he can prove if aught which he can bring,<br />
Is fit to harbour for the worth it holds.<br />
The fame of all the great, first as a bud appears,<br />
And daily spreads till gay perfections shine;<br />
So must it ever be to those who rise;<br />
And thus I claim indulgence at thy hand.<br />
Raised with fair hope, I leave thee to the task,<br />
And trust that of a judgment wise and good<br />
Ye will declare a fair decision, such<br />
As Justice (ever just) would deem it right<br />
To give to one confiding for the truth.<br />
I hold no purpose dark, but proudly tell<br />
I long to bear the barrier down which stays<br />
The narrow path unto the hill of Fame,<br />
And win a way unto the lustrous heights,<br />
When, looking hence, behold the seat of toil,<br />
And they who labor, striving to ascend;<br />
And now in sweet reflection view once more<br />
The days of old, when the like toil was mine.</p>
<h3>TO THE PEOPLE.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All ye who form, each in thy
mite, the vast<br />
And countless chaos of humanity,<br />
<!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>Named, as of use, &ldquo;The Public,&rdquo; I dispute<br
/>
No term as base or just, but join thereto<br />
An atom with the motley crowd, resigned,<br />
Of kings, and lords, and people, all as one,<br />
Who hold no claim as critic, seer, or sage,<br />
And spurn the name of Sloth as loathsome to<br />
The ear; who dwell within the pale, and breathe<br />
The air of this delirious age, when pomps<br />
And fashions rage throughout the land, and half<br />
Of all the people know not why they live,<br />
But live to feast on sensual delights,<br />
And deck the body with insipid show;<br />
When they who are not would be great and high;<br />
And, if their fortune doth not bear them on<br />
With the incessant speed they seek, then fraud<br />
Is called to aid, until the bubble bursts,<br />
Because the pressure is beyond the means;<br />
And they are cast, in anguish and despair,<br />
Unto the depths of ruin, there to lie<br />
With jeers of many pouring on to them.<br />
Unto the speech these times give slippery words,<br />
And to the tongue alike a flattering robe;<br />
That falsehood seems like unto sacred truth,<br />
And enmities the bonds of friendship seem.<br />
O rife Perfidity!&nbsp; O Vanity!<br />
O Pride!&nbsp; Great are thy ravages among<br />
<!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>This simple race, who for a lucre strive,<br />
And pomp, and gain, with an unquench&egrave;d thirst;<br />
Whose hand is avaricious, and who hold<br />
No check upon it; but, to swell their store<br />
In overflowing barns, do from the poor<br />
Extort unjust and utmost usury,<br />
Nor scruple have to snatch the morsel from<br />
The widow&rsquo;s mouth, or leave the orphan bare.<br />
When kings and rulers do for glory pant,<br />
Till thousands of their fellow mortals fall,<br />
In dead or wounded, at a single blow<br />
Laid prostrate, thus to feed their evil lust,<br />
Their satiate thirst which can no limit know.<br />
Or it may be for one&rsquo;s offended pride,<br />
Or some imagined insult to avenge<br />
With the outpouring of a people&rsquo;s blood.<br />
Oh! it doth seem an awful thing indeed<br />
That the wild demon should so rage in man,<br />
And that the learning of the present age<br />
Should not advance his wisdom more than now;<br />
But that, with vengeance rising from his path,<br />
He should in heedless haste go driving on<br />
To the dark pits of torture call&eacute;d &ldquo;Hell.&rdquo;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arise, ye slothful people! ye who
live<br />
In the soft ways of luxury and ease;<br />
Awake and sit in mooted ease no more,<br />
<!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>But count the stern realities of life.<br />
Ye who in drowsy slumber have destroyed,<br />
Have slept all these fair golden hours away,<br />
Whose footprints are inscribed upon thy brow,<br />
Think of the marks of sin against thy name,<br />
And say if no reproach doth sting thy soul.<br />
For why was man created?&nbsp; I may deem<br />
It were for nobler purpose than to waste&mdash;<br />
To sin and loll in idleness away&mdash;<br />
The only life which he shall ever live,<br />
Save in the long and last eternity.<br />
Cast idle sloth and sinfulness away,<br />
All ye who are the people; and, methinks,<br />
When that is done, I see a nobler race<br />
Begin to crown the land with joy and love,<br />
And tranquil, sweet, and fair prosperity.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Power is supreme, and power in unity<br
/>
Is thine, renown to give or keep, if ye<br />
Are of the few who walk in ways upright,<br />
(For it is joy to think there yet are some<br />
Who to their ways do give an earnest heed),<br />
Or with the crowd, who heed not how they go,<br />
But walk in blindness and in corrupt ways<br />
Unto a death which they will long to shun.<br />
Though foolish ye may deem me thus to come,<br />
And reason say this were a doubtful way<br />
<!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>To seek abroad for favor, yet it is<br />
Thy goodly favor which I come to ask;<br />
And I am but a novice, yet will hope<br />
Ye will not that withhold which seemeth just<br />
To give.&nbsp; Fair maidens, more than all, &rsquo;tis thine<br
/>
Approval which I long the most to gain.<br />
Ambition bids me rise, aspiring, bids<br />
Me seek from thee a word of favor, kind;<br />
For ye are more compassionate than man,<br />
And give your judgments in a softer way.<br />
If ye, and if the public, see it fit<br />
To render me a judgment good, then will<br />
My joy be full, and I shall strive anew;<br />
But, if ye give opposing judgment, then<br />
I yield my pen to better hands, and seek<br />
No more to speak, and from the quest of fame<br />
Return to calm seclusiveness again.</p>

16</span>INTRODUCTION.</h3>
<p>In the following Poem, the purpose of the Author shall be to
shew that man is born to vicissitudes, and to censure the
lewdness and frivolities to which he<br />
stoops.</p>
<p>To personate characters, time is represented by King
Nim&aelig;ra; birth, life, and death respectively by Kalim,
Weemus, and Sero; while mankind is represented by
Nim&aelig;ra&rsquo;s subjects, and the world by his kingdom,
heaven by &ldquo;The Land of Bliss,&rdquo; and hell by &ldquo;The
Pit of Terrors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honor from the many nations,<br

Honor from the scattered people,<br />
Honor much had King Nim&aelig;ra.<br />
King Nim&aelig;ra on his throne sat<br />
In his ancient power and greatness,<br />
In his modern pomp and splendor,<br />
With adornments full about him,<br />
With musicians ever by him,<br />
With advisers sitting round him,<br />
Till he needed of their wisdom;<br />
They were counted by the thousands,<br />
By the hundreds and the thousands.<br />
Sage-like was this King Nim&aelig;ra;<br />
Furrowed was his brow with seasons;<br />
Hoary were his locks and silvery,<br />
Ran the sportive breezes through them,<br />
Tossed them up in endless frolic.<br />
Mutely sat the aged monarch<br />
Mid the many lights and shadows,<br />
Mid the many scenes and changes<br />
Which for ever came around him,<br />

Smiling now at some adroitness,<br />
Frowning then at deeds of folly;<br />
And a mystic manner had he,<br />
Deep, and hidden, and mysterious,<br />
That the people could not fathom<br />
What he purposed for the future;<br />
Yet he loved this people fondly,<br />
And they fondly loved their monarch.<br />
In their sorrow he beheld them,<br />
And would comfort sometimes offer,<br />
As, in joy and mirth elated,<br />
He would sometimes bring them sadness.<br />
These were dealings mystic to them,<br />
Yet they were for good intended.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Springtime saw him calm and gentle,<br
/>
Sweet and pleasing in his manner;<br />
In the Summer he was joyful,<br />
Light and gay as some fair maiden<br />
In the time she seeks a wooer.<br />
These were seasons of rejoicing,<br />
And he called musicians forward,<br />
Skilled in every art of music,<br />
That the songs of night and morning,<br />
And the blooming of the daytime,<br />
Came from every hill and valley;<br />
<!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

With melodious floods of music.<br />
And in Autumn he came freely,<br />
With a hand in bounty flowing,<br />
Filling all the stores and garners<br />
With rich heaps of fruit the choicest,<br />
And with wine, and corn, and spices,<br />
That the heart of every subject<br />
Poured its thankful blessings on him.<br />
But in Winter he was gloomy,<br />
Dark, and dismal, and uncheerful,<br />
And sat brooding as in anger,<br />
Robed in garments dull and heavy;<br />
All gay vesture now forsaken,<br />
And all music now forbidden.<br />
Then the Winter turned and vanished<br />
As it came, unsought, uncherished,<br />
Now unmourned and unregretted;<br />
And the Spring again came dancing,<br />
Casting charms around profusely<br />
By the lanes, and woods, and waters,<br />
And brought music, mirth, and gladness,<br />
That the monarch heard the gay notes,<br />
And removed his sombre garments,<br />
And his frowns and dismal broodings,<br />
Donning in their stead right gladly<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Three great princes had Nim&aelig;ra,<br
/>
Who held each a post of honor<br />
In the ruling of the kingdom,<br />
In the keeping of the subjects.<br />
Wisdom had they, and were vested<br />
Much in favor, much in honor;<br />
And a spirit moved within them,<br />
Guiding and directing always.<br />
&rsquo;Twas a spirit high and sacred,<br />
From the Maker of the kingdom,<br />
Who in pow&rsquo;r set King Nim&aelig;ra,<br />
And who watched for ever on it<br />
With an eye of keen discerning,<br />
To behold if Justice guarded<br />
Every action of the rulers.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kalim was a prince the foremost,<br />
Who brought people to the kingdom,<br />
Made them of a wondrous matter,<br />
Moulded, fashioned, and designed them,<br />
Limbs and bodies full of senses,<br />
Some with beauties and attractions,<br />
Comely in their forms and graces,<br />
Others wanting and imperfect,<br />
And repulsive in appearance.<br />
<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

Left them in his care for training,<br />
Heeding not how that was ordered,<br />
But returned without delaying,<br />
Backward to his own seclusion,<br />
Homeward to his mystic working;<br />
For his only thoughts resided,<br />
And his only glory rested,<br />
In the numbers he created,<br />
In their beauty of formation,<br />
Which in secret depths he fashioned.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weemus was a prince the second,<br />
Great among the princely chieftains;<br />
He was keeper of the subjects,<br />
Took them from the hands of Kalim<br />
Young and tender as a blossom,<br />
Fed the spirit in their bosom,<br />
Cared and kept them out of danger,<br />
Framed them unto firmer being,<br />
Led them unto good or evil,<br />
Led them on to pomp and glory,<br />
Rising out of great achievements,<br />
By these ways to wealth and grandeur,<br />
Scattered on their footpaths wisdom&mdash;<br />
Wisdom, knowledge, and discretion,<br />
Evils, vices, lust, and anger,<br />
<!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>As a sower scatters corn-seed;<br />
Let them gather as they listed<br />
Of the good or of the evil.<br />
They had powers of true discernment,<br />
To direct them as they gathered<br />
Which were good and which were evil,<br />
Written and engraved on records,<br />
Words of endless power and meaning;<br />
And a few the good selected,<br />
Gathered from a wise discretion;<br />
But the crowds were blind and heedless,<br />
Minded not the laws and records,<br />
Gathered freely of the evil,<br />
Wandered on in lusts and vices,<br />
Wandered on to spoil and plunder,<br />
Wandered on to want and sorrow,<br />
Misery, and pain, and anguish.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Strange his dealings were and hidden;<br
/>
Oft would take the greatest boaster,<br />
Mighty in his own beholding,<br />
Who in pomp and riches loitered,<br />
In high seats of veneration,<br />
And would draw him downward, downward,<br />
Rob him of his pomp and splendor,<br />
Of his riches and his glory,<br />
Set him by the homeless beggar,<br />

Gladly feeding on the morsels<br />
Given by the poor and humble,<br />

Soon he learns his frail condition,<br />
And that he is only mortal.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or the unpretending stranger,<br />
From a poor and humble dwelling,<br />
And unknown among the people,<br />
Weemus oft would take and guide him<br />
High unto a seat of honor,<br />
To reside in noble mansions,<br />
Fame and praise for ever by him.<br />
Thuswise Weemus often acted,<br />
Fearless of rebuke or censure,<br />
And accounted not his reasons,<br />
Dealing ever as he listed.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sero was the third prince
call&eacute;d;<br />
He was stern, and fierce, and warlike;<br />
Fear and terror walked before him<br />
In the sight of all the people,<br />
And his bearing was majestic;<br />
Quick and keen his glances darted,<br />
Like a strong man&rsquo;s arrow flying;<br />
And the people tried to shun him,<br />
<!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>To avoid the ways he haunted;<br />
And they trembled sadly, sorely,<br />
If he ever ventured near them.<br />
Yet beneath his hardened manner<br />
Dwelt a gentle spirit calmly;<br />
It was only to the wicked,<br />
To the evil and the sinful,<br />
That his terror was reveal&eacute;d.<br />
Sero from the hands of Weemus<br />
Took the people rudely, boldly,<br />
As directed by the spirit<br />
Which for ever ruled his actions.<br />
Old, and young, and middle-aged,<br />
Heedless of their years he took them,<br />
Heedless of their power or greatness,<br />
Heedless of their worth or beauty,<br />
Or of want or low attainments;<br />
Pious-minded, vain, and sinful,<br />
Fell alike to be remov&eacute;d.<br />
There were some who longed his coming<br />
To relieve them of their burden,<br />
And admit them to the bright realms<br />
Which he watched, and kept, and guarded,<br />
There to rest in peace and tranquil,<br />
Sheltered from the wars and tumults,<br />
From the storms, and fears, and terrors<br />
<!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>Which were ever raging freely<br />
Throughout all the lands of Weemus.<br />
They had seen in feeble vision&mdash;<br />
Seen a ray of future glory,<br />
Of the sweet and happy pleasures<br />
In this kingdom Sero guarded;<br />
Longed and panted for admission,<br />
Toiled and labored for a passport,<br />
Fought and battled for a title<br />
To this realm where trouble is not,<br />
Till they had become the victors,<br />
And were waiting now to enter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Throughout all Nim&aelig;ra&rsquo;s
kingdom<br />
Warning heralds Sero sent out<br />
To implore the heedless people,<br />
Raising thus their warning voices:<br />
&ldquo;Turn, ye people, turn from evil,<br />
Know ye that the day is nearing<br />
For the long and weary journey<br />
Through dark valleys and wild passes<br />
To the lands of the hereafter.<br />
Be ye ready for departure,<br />
Robed and girded for the journey;<br />
For our guide, the princely Sero,<br />
Cometh; he is soon before you.<br />
If you are not waiting ready,<br />
<!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>He will not delay the journey,<br />
But will in the darkness leave you,<br />
Which ye cannot wander out of,<br />
From its terrors or its dangers,<br />
Till it take you to destruction,<br />
To an everlasting torment.&rdquo;<br />
Thus the warning heralds wandered,<br />
Oft complaining, oft imploring<br />
Unto all the erring people,<br />
Unto all the slothful numbers;<br />
But they were so bound in pleasures,<br />
Were in sin and lust so tangled,<br />
That they heeded not the warning&mdash;<br />
The kind words of warning spoken;<br />
Which were lost and vainly wasted,<br />
Were as mists upon a bulwark,<br />
Bearing with them no impression,<br />
Save unto a sorry number&mdash;<br />
But a few who heard and listened,<br />
And returned from evil doing<br />
Unto ways of truth and knowledge.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And of Sero let me tell you.<br />
He was keeper of the passes<br />
Leading to the land of Wisdom&mdash;<br />
Wisdom, clothed in radiant glory;<br />
And unto the lands of Darkness&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>Darkness, clothed in every horror.<br />
With bewailing he was girded,<br />
To that band a key suspended;<br />
He was girded with rejoicing,<br />
To that band a key suspended.<br />
These were keys wherewith he opened,<br />
Opened he therewith the wickets,<br />
To allow the people entrance<br />
As the passport they presented.<br />
Just between the wickets sat he,<br />
Wide his dusky pinions spreading,<br />
One upon each entrance holding;<br />
And above him waved a banner,<br />
In its colors dull and dismal;<br />
Deep and solemn was the motto,<br />
Was the warning written on it;<br />
Thus it was in bold description&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Woe is for the evildoer;<br />
For the upright, joy and gladness.&rdquo;<br />
And a voice beside him echoed,<br />
In sonorous sounds and loudly,<br />
Tones of gladness, tones of sadness,<br />
&ldquo;Hark ye, hark ye, all who wander,<br />
Woe is for the evildoer;<br />
For the upright, joy and gladness.&rdquo;<br />
In his right hand Sero wielded,&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

And it was a sword of terror;<br />
For the evil, but beholding,<br />
Trembled as an aspen leaflet,<br />
Shuddered as the ruined shudder.<br />
Wonder mov&eacute;d all the people<br />
While they listened to the sayings,<br />
To the wonders he unfolded<br />
Of the regions which he guarded.<br />
Thus he made his mystic sayings:<br />
&ldquo;Through this wicket on my right hand<br />
Is a vale of noble grandeur,<br />
Placid and surpassing lovely,<br />
Which the pilgrim, as he enters,<br />
Hails with overflowing gladness.<br />
Seraphs from the holy regions&mdash;<br />
Oh, so sweet, and so inviting!&mdash;<br />
Meet him as he enters therein;<br />
Through the pleasant passes guide him,<br />
By the banks of streamlets gliding,<br />
With a constant music laden;<br />
Mellow light-beams on them dancing,<br />
Waltzing to the streamlet&rsquo;s music;<br />
Music soft and so melodious<br />
Rising from the groves around them;<br />
Groves of myrtle and of woodbine<br />
<!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>Full of odors rich and soothing,<br />
Rising from the flowery vials;<br />
Flowers which clothe the banks, adorning,<br />
Till the breezes hail their essence;<br />
Zephyrs soft, and fair, and gentle,<br />
Take these balmy odors with them,<br />
Throughout all the holy regions.<br />
Thus he wanders onward, onward,<br />
With his angel guides advancing,<br />
Wrapt in wonder and adorement,<br />
Raptured with the matchless beauty,<br />
Till a softer music cometh,<br />
Sweeter than the notes around him,<br />
On the distance flowing sweetly.<br />
Soon the strains come nearer, clearer,<br />
And he wonders why the music.<br />
&lsquo;Whence these songs of mirth and gladness?&rsquo;<br />
Asketh thus his angel escort.<br />
&lsquo;Where and whence these sounds melodious?<br />
Whose are all these festive voices?<br />
What the cause of such rejoicing?&rsquo;<br />
And the spirits answer thuswise:<br />
&lsquo;These are bands of angels singing<br />
In the happy land of Blessing,<br />
In the lofty halls of gladness.<br />
Seraphs from their golden harps draw<br />
<!-- page 30--><a name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
30</span>Notes to swell the songs of gladness.<br />
These are songs of glad rejoicings<br />
For another pilgrim nearing,&mdash;<br />
One escaped the land of bondage.<br />
This the source of these rejoicings.&rsquo;<br />
Ere this answer hath been spoken,<br />
Lo! before them rise the portals<br />
Of the holy land of Blessing.<br />
This the city he hath heard of<br />
In such sweet and wondrous stories,<br />
Whence he longed in patient waiting<br />
To arrive at, now before him.<br />
How enraptured he beholdeth<br />
All its dazzling brightness spreading,<br />
As he nearer comes and nearer<br />
To the haven of his journey,<br />
Thousand times ten thousands grander<br />
Than his brightest fancies thought of.<br />
Sparkling, bounding in its brightness,<br />
Comes the soft and cheering fair light,<br />
Rolling o&rsquo;er the diamond bulwarks,<br />
Flowing through the golden portals,<br />
Like ten thousand fairy sunbeams.<br />
All the bulwarks are of diamond,<br />
And of purest gold the portals;<br />
Paved of brightest gems the courts are;<br />

Sapphire blocks and blocks of ruby,<br />
Emerald bars and bars of opal,<br />
Rows of amethyst and topaz,<br />
Sparkling in their golden framework.<br />
Lofty are the walls and mighty,<br />
Rising unto heights unmeasured,<br />
Mighty, strong beyond conception.<br />
Round the outer palisading<br />
Of the diamond walls are watching<br />
Many hosts from the Sabaoth<br />
Of the King of all these bright realms.<br />
Sleepless are their eyes and piercing,<br />
Terrible they are in battle;<br />
Nothing can uphold against them.<br />
They are clad in mail of pure white,<br />
Brilliant and of dazzling splendor;<br />
Helmets have they, white and burnished,<br />
Feathery white plumes in them waving;<br />
Brilliant also are their breastplates,<br />
And their shields, with &lsquo;Love&rsquo; engraven<br />
On the front in golden letters,<br />
Are most gorgeous in beholding<br />
When the light streams full upon them;<br />
And destruction is the weapon<br />
They employ to guard the city;<br />

To the foe who dares approach them.<br />
Now before the golden gateway,<br />
Which with massive bars is builded,<br />
Stands the pilgrim with his escort;<br />
And they sound a mighty trumpet,<br />
That the strains in thrilling grandeur<br />
Flow sonorous through the kingdom.<br />
Then behold the keeper cometh,<br />
Who the gateway ever keepeth,<br />
To unfold the golden barrings;<br />
And he throws the gate wide open,<br />
And the pilgrim enters therein<br />
Now into the holy regions.<br />
There a band of seraphs meet him,<br />
Chosen from the ranks around them,<br />
Guide him to the shining white throne,<br />
Where the King in glory sitteth.<br />
And the holy King says, &lsquo;Welcome,<br />
Welcome to you, pilgrim, brother!&rsquo;<br />
And he bids an angel bring him&mdash;<br />
Bring him royal robes and robe him,<br />
Garments rich, and white, and lovely,<br />
And a golden crown to crown him.<br />

All in flowing garments vested,<br />

Dancing on their crowns of glory,<br />
Far and near redounding, flowing<br />
In a thousand dazzling colors,<br />
Like unto a flood of crystal.<br />
Silent are they all and heedful<br />

High amid the radiant brightness,<br />
Till his silver wand is rais&eacute;d;<br />
Then for music every trumpet,<br />
Every lute, and every timbrel,<br />
Every harp is strung and ready,<br />
And for songs wait all the voices.<br />
Lo! it falls, and floods melodious<br />
Flow from every voice united,<br />
Rise from every lute and timbrel,<br />
Stream from every harp and trumpet.<br />

From the vaults and arches flying,<br />
In the distant spaces rising<br />
Over thrones, and crowns, and mansions,<br />
Breaking o&rsquo;er the vitreous white throne;<br />

Casting down its charms around it,<br />
Ever softest, sweetest, fairest;<br />
Softly as the summer showereth,<br />
From its fragrant bosom, largely,<br />
Dews upon the sleeping meadow.<br />
This is honor to the pilgrim,<br />
Welcome to his seat of glory;<br />
Songs of joy that he is landed<br />
From the perils of the journey<br />
To be one for ever with them.<br />
Now beside the throne he standeth,<br />
In his bosom gladness flowing.<br />

Calmness, as in death, prevaileth.<br />
Now he sits enthroned amid them,<br />
And again the strains are wakened,<br />
Mighty as to storms of thunder<br />
Born as from the womb of calmness,<br />
Rising as from death released.<br />
Now his voice is with them mingled<br />
In the songs, and hymns, and anthems,<br />
Which shall evermore continue<br />
Throughout all this land of Blisses,<br />
Where is love the only bondage,<br />
Love the mighty power which holds them.&rdquo;<br />

Blinded them with show and grandeur,<br />
Gave them longings and ambitions,<br />
That they lost their true discernment,<br />
As a man with wines confus&eacute;d<br />
Loses proper sense and caution.<br />
And they gave such sumptuous meetings,<br />
And they said such wondrous fair things&mdash;<br />
Things that ne&rsquo;er before were heard of,<br />
That the dazzled people followed;<br />
And they reaped a mighty harvest,<br />
Leading, drawing as they listed;<br />
For this was a simple people,<br />
Credulous, and blind, and simple.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now the Maker of the kingdom,<br />
<!-- page 42--><a name="page42"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
42</span>From his pure and dazzling white throne,<br />
Looked and saw the dreadful havoc<br />
Raging mid Nim&aelig;ra&rsquo;s people,<br />
And it vexed him very sorely;<br />
For he loved the people fondly<br />
Who were wisely formed by Kalim:<br />
Bones, with matter moulded on them,<br />
Fraught with channels, watercourses,<br />
And red rivers running through them,<br />
From a mystic fountain rising,<br />
Flowing ever fast and constant,<br />
Giving and diffusing vigor<br />
Through the many wondrous members.<br />
Counsel took He to restore them<br />
From destruction&rsquo;s ruthless havoc,<br />
In an earnest consultation<br />
Saying ever and repeating,<br />
&ldquo;We must save this ruined people;<br />
We must give them light and caution:<br />
Light, to shew their wayward goings;<br />
Caution, to direct them rightly.&rdquo;<br />
So a band of spirits went out,<br />
Builded with a holy ardour,<br />
Sped athrough the heights and spaces<br />
To Nim&aelig;ra&rsquo;s kingdom, saying:<br />
&ldquo;We will reason with this people;<br />
<!-- page 43--><a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>Reason boldly, turn and change them,<br />
Warn them of the evil spirits,<br />
Shew them thrones, and crowns, and mansions,<br />
As a trophy of repentance,<br />
Till they cannot fail but hear us,<br />
Till they turn in great rejoicing.&rdquo;<br />
Thus the spirits went and wandered,<br />
Talked and reasoned with the people,<br />
Shewing thrones, and crowns, and mansions,<br />
Using every power and effort<br />
To persuade them of the folly,<br />
Of the dangers they were choosing.<br />
They who heard the deep entreaties<br />
For a minute turned to listen;<br />
Felt the powers within them moving<br />
Striving to believe and follow.<br />
But, a little season longer,<br />
When the spirits pass&eacute;d from them,<br />
They returned unto the rapids,<br />
To the mighty stream of ruin<br />
Rolling onward to destruction;<br />
For they were so much enamoured<br />
By the cunning fascinations<br />
Which the evil spirits gave them<br />
That they lack&eacute;d strength and courage,<br />
And they failed to turn and follow,<br />
<!-- page 44--><a name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
44</span>Save a very little number,<br />
Who restrained their lusts and wishes,<br />
And gave heed unto the sayings<br />
Which the kindly spirits bore them,<br />
Gaining power, the more they harken&rsquo;d,<br />
To withstand the evil spirits,<br />
And to baffle their endeavours.<br />
These went to the land of Blisses;<br />
But for one who Sero pass&eacute;d<br />
Through the wicket on his right hand,<br />
Going to the holy regions,<br />
Seven pass&eacute;d on his left hand,<br />
Going to the pit of terrors.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that I have told you fairly,<br />
Shewing as is due to render<br />
Of the powers of King Nim&aelig;ra<br />
And his three most favored princes,<br />
Giving Sero&rsquo;s own description<br />
Of the wonders of the regions<br />
Which lie hid within the wickets<br />
Which he ever proudly guardeth,<br />
Will you listen when I tell you,&mdash;<br />
Will you hearken to the stories<br />
I can give you of Nim&aelig;ra,<br />
And his three most powerful princes,<br />
And their dealings with the people?<br />
<!-- page 45--><a name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
45</span>I shall do my best to render<br />
Stories such as will entice you;<br />
Though my voice is low and feeble,<br />
Though my pen is slow and wayward,<br />
Never moving fair and fluent,<br />
As the spirit which directs it<br />
Would that it should move and tell you.<br />
They shall but be little stories,<br />
Gathered from the many records<br />
Which the people kept and courted<br />
In their halls, and towns, and cities.</p>
<h4>I.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sailing o&rsquo;er the sparkling
waters,<br />
With accordant breezes favoured,<br />
Came a vessel homeward bearing,<br />
And a gladsome people on it.<br />
Sang they songs, and danced, and sported;<br />
Sadness was unknown amid them;<br />
Old, and young, and middle-ag&eacute;d<br />
Were they, and of divers stations.<br />
While their pleasures were the fullest,<br />
Sero saw their joys and pondered,&mdash;<br />
Pondered with his inward spirit:<br />
&ldquo;Lo! they have an idle fancy,<br />
All their thoughts are gay and heedless,<br />
<!-- page 46--><a name="page46"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
46</span>And they dream not of destruction,<br />
Think not of a danger nearing,<br />
Nor will hearken to the warnings<br />
Which are ever spoken to them.<br />
Ere another morn has wakened<br />
Shall their joys be turned to mourning.<br />
I will send, and turn, and change them.&rdquo;<br />
Said he to retainers by him,<br />
&ldquo;Seest thou that fair-like vessel,<br />
And the mirthful crew upon it?<br />
Go, and captive make the number,<br />
And their spirits hither bring me;<br />
But their bodies can be portioned<br />
To the monsters of the ocean.<br />
Neptune I shall call and waken;<br />
He will lend me storms and tempests,<br />
Lightnings and mighty thunders,<br />
Which shall in the mission aid thee,<br />
Give an awful grandeur to it;<br />
Like the flowing of great banners,<br />
And as many torches blazing,<br />
And the sounds of drums and trumpets,<br />
Shall be storms, and flames, and thunder.&rdquo;<br />
So the mission goeth forthwith<br />
O&rsquo;er the still and tranquil waters;<br />
And they waken slumbering Neptune,<br />
<!-- page 47--><a name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
47</span>Who advanceth storms and tempests;<br />
And the waves rise up in anger,<br />
Foam and hiss in reckless fury;<br />
Thunders bellow martial music;<br />
Lightnings flash their vivid torchlight.<br />
Grand and mighty the procession!<br />
Neptune, in majestic pomp, came<br />
In his chariot, attended<br />
By a myriad mystic beings,<br />
To direct the storms and thunders,<br />
And to rule the foaming billows.<br />
Spake he thus unto the waters:<br />
&ldquo;Ope your gates, ye billows, open,<br />
That great Sero&rsquo;s host may enter<br />
With the booty they have taken,<br />
And the bodies of their captives,<br />
Which shall in my caverns slumber,<br />
In my rocky halls and grottos.&rdquo;<br />
Then the mighty gates were opened;<br />
And they all went downward, down,<br />
Down into the dark, cold waters,<br />
With their cries and earnest prayers,<br />
Wailings bitter and lamentings.<br />
Woeful was the scene to witness:<br />
Children clinging to their mothers,<br />
Husbands in their wives&rsquo; embraces,<br />
<!-- page 48--><a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>Brothers by their sisters holding,<br />
Others running wild and madly,<br />
Crying to their gods for succour;<br />
Every heart in very terror<br />
Quailing at the rising future.<br />
But these cries cannot be answered;<br />
They have sought too late for succour;<br />
For the gates are closed upon them,<br />
And the victors have their spirits,<br />
Bearing to their princely Sero,<br />
And their bodies are consign&eacute;d<br />
To the halls of mighty Neptune.<br />
Then did Sero take the spirits<br />
As the mission brought them to him;<br />
And for every one which entered<br />
By the wicket on his right hand,<br />
Leading to the land of gladness,<br />
Seven by the other entered,<br />
Down into the pit of terrors.</p>
<h4>II.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stood a fair and stately
dwelling<br />
In the concourse of the people,<br />
Of the lofty of the people;<br />
Looked it on the smaller buildings<br />
Downward in a scornful manner;<br />
<!-- page 49--><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
49</span>Proud was it of fine appearance,<br />
Proud the people who dwelt in it.<br />
There the arts of every nation<br />
Met with the united purpose<br />
To adorn and to give splendor<br />
To the chambers of this mansion,<br />
To its corridors and landings.<br />
Ottomans of downy velvet<br />
In the looms of Utrecht woven,<br />
Vases of Chinese production,<br />
Crystals, bright and burnished figures,<br />
Models made of gold and silver,<br />
Tapestry, and lace, and network,<br />
Carpets from the looms of Brussels,<br />
Woven into gaudy figures.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a certain gorgeous chamber,<br />
In apparel likewise gorgeous,<br />
Sat a mighty, pompous woman.<br />
Very high were her ideas<br />
Of her own expanded person,<br />
And her own unmeasured value;<br />
All the world would not contain them,<br />
They were so elate and soaring.<br />
Luxury and ease were round her,<br />
As she fancied to receive them;<br />
And a host of powdered servants<br />
<!-- page 50--><a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>Waited idly for her orders.<br />
Now she calls for an attendant,<br />
And doth give him orders thuswise:<br />
&ldquo;&lsquo;Not at home&rsquo; shall be the answer<br />
Unto all who this day seek me,<br />
Save unto his highness Fashion;<br />
Ye shall give to him admission.&rdquo;<br />
State obeisance marks his exit,<br />
Ready for a plumper falsehood,<br />
Spoken to his lady&rsquo;s order.<br />
Soon a knock, which sounds familiar.<br />
Lo! it is the dunning trader,<br />
Who is sorely run to hold him<br />
From the stream of dangerous rumours;<br />
But the answer thus is told him&mdash;<br />
&ldquo;Not at home, my lady is not.&rdquo;<br />
So the tradesman from her doorway,<br />
Empty-handed, homeward turns,<br />
Thinks not such a ready answer<br />
Is an utter fabrication.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sero, from his seat beholding,<br />
Saw this lounging lump of matter,<br />
Puff&eacute;d up in pomp and splendor.<br />
He was moved to indignation,<br />
And said, in a scornful manner,<br />
&ldquo;O blinded fool!&nbsp; O filthy pomp!<br />
<!-- page 51--><a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>Glory ye in dust and shadows?<br />
See ye not the wild delusions,<br />
Which ye cherish so and fondle,<br />
Through the darkness they are set in?&rdquo;<br />
Said he to attendants by him,<br />
&ldquo;Go ye to that stately chamber<br />
Where this pompous woman sitteth;<br />
Pass the trader in the doorway<br />
And the ready story-teller,<br />
Enter and lay hold upon her;<br />
Take the lusty look she weareth,<br />
Cast it to the winds that ramble,<br />
Racing through the hills and mountains;<br />
Take her great imaginations,<br />
Sift them in the seive of honor&mdash;<br />
Lo! they are as dross and ashes,<br />
And her pomps and giddy grandeur<br />
Scatter and disperse them likewise.&rdquo;<br />
So went Sero&rsquo;s servants forward,<br />
Did as had their chief commanded,<br />
Smote this pompous woman sorely&mdash;<br />
With the rod of sickness smote her;<br />
And the ruddy color left her,<br />
And those lofty airs and manners;<br />
Sickness and a ghastly pallor<br />
Came upon her limbs and forehead,<br />
<!-- page 52--><a name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
52</span>And she hourly sank and wasted<br />
Till a spectre she resembled.<br />
Then the spirit fled the body,<br />
And was carried unto Sero;<br />
Sero through the wicket passed it<br />
To the pit of Long Damnation.<br />
What is now this pompous woman,<br />
And her great imagination?<br />
These have vanished like a shadow,<br />
As a myth or phantom figure;<br />
And that body, once so lusty,<br />
Is a mouldering lump of matter,<br />
Corruptible, and vile, and filthy.</p>
<h4>III.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a miserable dwelling<br />
Sat a miserable old man<br />
Mid a heap of hoarded treasures,<br />
Buried in the walls and burrows;<br />
And it was his constant idol,<br />
And his brain was ever scheming<br />
How he might augment the numbers.<br />
Oft he turned the treasure over,<br />
Counting fondly and recounting;<br />
And he joyed to hear the jingle<br />
Of the yellow coins he counted.<br />
<!-- page 53--><a name="page53"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
53</span>Threescore years had been devoted,<br />
Scraping of this gain together.<br />
He had fed on scanty portion,<br />
Grudging sorely every morsel;<br />
And had clothed himself in raiments<br />
Which a beggar scarce would stand in.<br />
He had never fed the hungry,<br />
And had never clothed the naked,<br />
That he might increase his riches.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sero in this hovel saw him<br />
Bending o&rsquo;er his golden treasures;<br />
And he laughed derisive laughter,<br />
And sarcastic was his manner,<br />
As his servants he commanded<br />
To the miser&rsquo;s presence, saying,<br />
&ldquo;Lo! our princely Sero wisteth<br />
Whence are all these hoarded riches,&mdash;<br />
If in scruple they were gathered.<br />
If ye long to take them with you<br />
When you leave this land of Weemus<br />
For the lands of the hereafter;<br />
If ye think to buy a passport<br />
To the land of Blisses with them,<br />
Ye are sadly much mistaken.<br />
This we deem as dross and worthless.<br />
Ye can never enter thereto<br />
<!-- page 54--><a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
54</span>Bearing such a burden with you.<br />
Ye must feed the hungry with it,<br />
And must clothe the naked wanderer,<br />
And employ it as a talent<br />
To be used for wiser purpose<br />
Than to hoard in walls and burrows,<br />
If ye long to be admitted<br />
To the tranquil land of Blisses.&rdquo;<br />
But the old man would not listen<br />
To the words of wisdom spoken;<br />
He was so engrossed in counting,<br />
And in adding to his riches.<br />
So the servant raised his weapon,<br />
Sorely therewith smote the miser,&mdash;<br />
With destruction did he smite him,&mdash;<br />
That he fell a lifeless clay-heap<br />
Down among the hoarded moneys;<br />
And his spirit was remov&eacute;d<br />
Unto Sero, and he opened<br />
Wide the wicket on his left hand,<br />
And it passed into the darkness,<br />
To the pit of gloom and terrors.<br />
Then the door was rudely opened<br />
Of this miserable dwelling<br />
By the people claiming kinship;<br />
And they scrambled for the riches,<br />
<!-- page 55--><a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
55</span>And in many quarrels sought them,<br />
Tending to the disuniting<br />
Of the sacred bonds of friendship;<br />
Brother against brother rising,<br />
Raging in a bitter conflict.<br />
Many, who received a portion,<br />
Went and squandered to his ruin<br />
All he had in lust and gambling,<br />
Till his life was sorely broken.<br />
When his riches had been pillaged,<br />
Then the body of the miser<br />
Was remov&eacute;d quick and coldly,<br />
Lowered in the grave and covered;<br />
But of they who followed with it,<br />
No one wept a tear of sorrow,<br />
No one mourned for his departure;<br />
But they gave attendance only,&mdash;<br />
That, stern duty had commanded.<br />
Thus the end was of the old man,<br />
Of the miserable miser.</p>
<h4>IV.</h4>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a wilderness of houses<br />
In the heart of a great city,<br />
Full of riches, full of plenty,<br />
And of people high and prosperous,<br />
<!-- page 56--><a name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
56</span>Of its ancient greatness boasting,<br />
And its modern princely splendors;<br />
In a loathsome and a dark street,<br />
Foulsome odors rising from it,<br />
Rife and pregnant with diseases,<br />
Stood a hovel, foul and filthy;<br />
Lay a being, wane and wasted,<br />
On a straw heap in a corner;<br />
Scarce a rag to hide her person,<br />
Lice and vermin creeping on her;<br />
And beside her stood distraction,<br />
Woe, and want, and piercing hunger;<br />
And her look was wild and vacant,<br />
Like a spectre&rsquo;s, wandering madly.<br />
When the night came, it was laden<br />
Much with gloomy fear and sadness,<br />
And a trembling apprehension<br />
That the dawn would not approach her;<br />
And the morning was attended<br />
With but little hope or succour.<br />
Charity, in cold attendance,<br />
Came with many words and wishes;<br />
And, in fair and full pretending,<br />
Stood, and pitied, and regretted;<br />
But it gave a meagre pittance<br />
Or of comfort or appeasing,<br />
<!-- page 57--><a name="page57"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
57</span>To withdraw the pangs of hunger,<br />
Or relieve her sunken spirit.<br />
But good Sero saw in pity.<br />
He beheld her calm endurance<br />
Of the anguish bearing on her;<br />
And he sent and took her spirit&mdash;<br />
Took it gently from the ruin,<br />
From the filth and the pollution;<br />
And he opened wide the wicket<br />
By his right hand, and conveyed it<br />
From the misery and anguish<br />
To the happy land of Blisses,<br />
To the land of peace and plenty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the burden of my stories<br
/>
I shall not detain you further,<br />
Lest ye weary to pursue them<br />
Through the dreary way they lead you.<br />
Let me further only mention,<br />
Sero&rsquo;s servants were engag&eacute;d<br />
Ever seeking and conveying<br />
Subjects from the hands of Weemus<br />
To the watch-ward of their chieftain.<br />
Mute and mystic were their movements;<br />
Softly, and without observance,<br />
Passed they to the secret chamber,&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 58--><a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>Took from thence the hidden subject;<br />
From the lover&rsquo;s fond embraces<br />
Tore away his dearest treasure&mdash;<br />
She, to whom his life was wedded,<br />
Was for ever sworn betroth&eacute;d;<br />
Went into the stately dwelling,<br />
And the lowly and the humble,<br />
Heedless of position took them;<br />
To the sacred courts of prayer,<br />
Where the Maker of the kingdoms<br />
Held communion with the people;<br />
And into the gay assemblies,<br />
To the scenes of mirth and gladness,<br />
Where were songs and revel dances,<br />
In a maddened fulness rising.<br />
Many widows left they mourning&mdash;<br />
Widows wailing, orphans weeping,<br />
In unmitigated sorrow,<br />
For the loss of near and dear ones.<br />
Hard and cruel seemed their dealings<br />
In the sight of all the people;<br />
For they could not learn the purpose<br />
Which, in all their acts, directed.<br />
Yet these were most wisely ordered;<br />
For the Maker of the kingdom,<br />
Of Nim&aelig;ra&rsquo;s kingdom,&mdash;moved them&mdash;<br />
Moved, and guided, and informed them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 59--><a

land of Blisses<br />
Pass&eacute;d all the just and lowly;<br />
They whose lives had been preserv&eacute;d<br />
From the soiling stains of evil;<br />
Who had lived in single purpose,<br />
Holy and uprightly always;<br />
Who had made oblations fitting,<br />
Praise and honor to the Founder<br />
Of Nim&aelig;ra and his kingdom;<br />
And had made a full endeavour<br />
In obeying the commandments<br />
Which were written for their guidance;<br />
Who of charity gave freely<br />
Unto all the poor and needy,<br />
And, in giving, had no purpose<br />
Selfishly to further thereby.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But unto the pit of terrors<br />
Evil and unrighteous people,<br />
All the lukewarm and the heedless<br />
Of the order of the statutes,<br />
All blasphemers and revilers,<br />
And all foul and filthy talkers,<br />
Liars, brawlers, and adulterers,<br />
They whose hands are stained in murder,<br />
All the proud and haughty boasters,<br />
All licentious and deceivers,<br />
<!-- page 60--><a name="page60"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
60</span>They who are the poor&rsquo;s oppressors,<br />
Robbers and unjust receivers,&mdash;<br />
These for ever had their portion<br />
In the pit of gloom and terrors.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If ye wonder at its greatness<br
/>
And the grand and deep foundation<br />
Of the kingdom of Nim&aelig;ra,<br />
We will take a tour and see it,<br />
Going unto every limit<br />
Where Nim&aelig;ra great in power is,<br />
Where he holds his goodly council,<br />
Chief of all the powers beside him.<br />
From the womb of words it came forth,<br />
Out of chaos and of darkness,<br />
First in rude and wild confusion,<br />
Then arranged in goodly order;<br />
Lands and waters, woods and pastures,<br />
And with moving creatures peopled.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First, behold the orbs above us,<br />
Which are ever sparkling brightly;<br />
Let us upward rise and see them&mdash;<br />
See their great and many wonders,<br />
With a wonder rising mountains<br />
Through the circuit they are set in.<br />
These are worlds like our own one,<br />
<!-- page 61--><a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
61</span>And have each their separate people,<br />
Laws, and customs, and strange dealings;<br />
And these worlds are ever turning,<br />
Moving round the orbs of splendor,<br />
Fix&eacute;d, in the height of spaces,<br />
For a light and heat unto them.<br />
Now we wonder if these people<br />
Are by evil spirits haunted,<br />
Which incite them to rebellion,<br />
And destroy their God-like image;<br />
But we cannot solve the wonder,<br />
And must choose to sit in darkness.<br />
Then I guide you hence awayward<br />
From the sparkling of this system,<br />
From the sun&rsquo;s rebounding brightness,<br />
And the pale moon&rsquo;s ever-fair light,<br />
And the many colored star lights,<br />
Blended in a great profusion,<br />
To the limits of our world,<br />
Which we best can know and search in.<br />
First, unto the boundless ocean,<br />
By the billow which returneth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Echo to great Neptune&rsquo;s call,<br
/>
Where the mermaid host sojourneth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In his ancient rocky hall;<br />
Where Leviathan, the mighty<br />
<!-- page 62--><a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
62</span>Keeper of all Neptune&rsquo;s treasure,<br />
Roams around the rocky caverns<br />
In majestic state, exploring.<br />
Let us see these mighty waters<br />
When they rise in foaming billows,<br />
Swallowing towns, and ships, and people,<br />
Roaring like a mighty thunder;<br />
And, when they are still and peaceful,<br />
Like a plain of pasture spreading,<br />
Sleeping as a virgin sleepeth<br />
Ere vain love-dreams fill her bosom.<br />
Both these aspects are majestic,<br />
Grand, and pleasing, and inspiring.<br />
On a bark we will convey us<br />
Through the peering rocks and islands,<br />
Where the Summer brings its sunshine,<br />
And the Winter frost and snow-storms,<br />
For a season to the lone isles.<br />
Then unto the tropic regions,<br />
Where the proud sun pours its glory<br />
On the burning sandy deserts;<br />
Streams of brightness everlasting,<br />
Like ten thousand mountains blazing;<br />
And the khamsheens wild and fiercely<br />
Sweep in burning flakes along them,<br />
And torment the weary traveller<br />
<!-- page 63--><a name="page63"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
63</span>Who is slowly wading through them,<br />
Thirsting for a cooling river.<br />
And &rsquo;tis there the wild tornado<br />
Riseth in its frame of terror,<br />
Wild, and fierce, and unrelenting.<br />
To the spreading woods and forests<br />
Of the black pine and the myrtle,<br />
Of the cedar and the red birch,<br />
Of the oak tree and the walnut,<br />
Of the tulip and mahogany,<br />
All in branchy webwork blended,<br />
That the light can hardly enter<br />
To remove the clouds of darkness<br />
In the vast and deep recesses;<br />
Where the lion and the tiger,<br />
Where the panther and the leopard,<br />
And the jaguar and hy&aelig;na,<br />
And the tan wolf and the ocelot,<br />
In the daytime hold their parley,<br />
And resort for wakeful slumbers,<br />
Till the dusky hand of black night<br />
Draweth down her curtain on them;<br />
Then they leave the sylvan passes<br />
To traverse the open valley,<br />
Prowling after luckless surfeit,<br />
Lurking by the lakes and rivers<br />
<!-- page 64--><a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>For the panting prey which cometh<br />
To allay its thirsty feelings<br />
At their sweet and cooling waters.<br />
There the owl at midnight whoopeth,<br />
And the lions roar majestic,<br />
And the many prowling wild brutes<br />
Raise such divers sounds and noises,<br />
That it gives a fearful grandeur<br />
To the scene at hours of midnight.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To the rocky hills and mountains<br />
We will next direct our journey,<br />
Which with heathy robes are mantled,<br />
And whose heads are ever wearing<br />
Caps of snow of many ages.<br />
These are in adorning climates,<br />
Where the seasons bring their changes,<br />
Where comes hoary-headed white frost,<br />
And the plumy flakes of white snow,<br />
Showered around in bounty&rsquo;s largess,<br />
Lend the plains a pure white carpet,<br />
And the hills a dazzling wrapper,<br />
Which they don in princely grandeur,<br />
Till the herald voice resoundeth<br />
O&rsquo;er the mountains, hills, and valleys,<br />
From the orient regions coming:<br />
&ldquo;Haste ye, Winter, your departure,<br />

Comes our gentle queen to claim her<br />
Now the rule of this dominion.<br />
Hark how sweet the songs she bringeth!<br />
We shall give her welcome greetings.&rdquo;<br />
Now the peaceful vales and pastures<br />
All in beauty spread before us;<br />
And the fragrant kine are grazing,<br />
And the merry lambs run frisking<br />
Mid the perfumes of the meadow,<br />
From the odors of the Spring flowers;<br />
And the Cashet dove is cooing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love songs to its cherished mate;<br />
And the shepherd boy is wooing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By the rustic cottage gate.<br />
There the swains, in nature&rsquo;s freedom,<br />
Pour their mirth around profusely;<br />
And the ag&eacute;d people fondly<br />
See the mirth they once partook of.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now, from scenes so sweet and
pleasant,<br />
We must turn and journey onward;<br />
From the mountains&rsquo; rugged grandeur,<br />
Where the chamois and the wild deer<br />
<!-- page 66--><a name="page66"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
66</span>Roam in constant freedom over;<br />
Where the eagle soaring flyeth,<br />
Scouting with a keen beholding;<br />
And with thunders rolling by us,<br />
And with lightnings trouling round us,<br />
Seek for other scenes and fancies.<br />
Thence away unto the regions,<br />
Gliding o&rsquo;er the restless billows,<br />
Through the howling storms and tempests,<br />
Unto scenes of snow and icelands,<br />
Where the blocks of ice are dancing<br />
Like huge hills amid the billows,<br />
And the snows are ever sleeping,<br />
And the frosts are ever biting;<br />
Where the bears go prowling wildly,<br />
Creeping from their icy caverns.<br />
There we find a nature also,<br />
And a people who enjoy it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But that we have made a survey<br />
Rudely of the different regions,<br />
And in visits on our journey<br />
Have discerned the varying customs<br />
Of the many different people<br />
Who take glory in their white skins,<br />
Or of others who, alikewise,<br />
Build their pride in skins of copper;<br />
<!-- page 67--><a name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
67</span>Let us notice more minutely<br />
Scenes, and wonders, and behaviours<br />
On this kingdom of Nim&aelig;ra,<br />
As they often come before us.<br />
So the little stream we follow,<br />
Rising from a rocky mountain,<br />
See it moving onward, onward,<br />
Gathering force, and power, and beauty,<br />
Till it gets a rolling river,<br />
Sweeping onward to the ocean,<br />
Watering many pleasant valleys,<br />
Cheering many a thirsty traveller.<br />
This is like a man who riseth<br />
From a humble life and hidden<br />
Unto power, and wealth, and wisdom,<br />
Gaining large and goodly influence,<br />
Giving, as he upward rises,<br />
Courage unto needy pilgrims,<br />
Help unto the homeless wanderer.<br />
These are of Nim&aelig;ra&rsquo;s kingdom.<br />
But, as we have traced the river<br />
From its wild and rustic birthplace,<br />
Let us see the scenes beside it;<br />
And in wonder deep we ponder<br />
How all these things were created,<br />
And of the unbounded knowledge<br />
<!-- page 68--><a name="page68"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
68</span>Of the Being great who made them.<br />
First we pass the lake which spreadeth<br />
Wide its bosom to the sunshine,<br />
Or unto the winds and tempests;<br />
By its mountain bulwarks guarded,<br />
Which for everlasting passion<br />
Keep the couch whereon it sleepeth.<br />
Then the sweet and happy village,<br />
Standing in the peaceful valley,<br />
Fraught of fondest recollections<br />
Of the happy days of childhood<br />
Unto many far departed,<br />
Toiling through the world&rsquo;s courses.<br />
There is simple joy and humble,<br />
And in unity the daytime<br />
And the tranquil of the night time<br />
Keep harmonious pleasures by it.<br />
Stand around it woods and pastures,<br />
Full of song, and peace, and plenty;<br />
O&rsquo;er them softest winds are wafted,<br />
Sporting gently with the leaflets,<br />
Which unite in murmurs often,<br />
Seeming to reproach them thuswise:<br />
&ldquo;Why came ye so near our pillows,<br />
To disturb the peaceful order<br />
Of our slumbers sweet and soothing?&rdquo;<br />
<!-- page 69--><a name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
69</span>In the east behold the gay orb<br />
Leave its cradle for rejoicing<br />
O&rsquo;er its course in might and grandeur.<br />
On the west behold the pillow<br />
Where it lieth down to slumber.<br />
Next, as we go wandering onward<br />
From these rustic scenes and pleasing,<br />
Comes the city, overflowing<br />
With a motley population.<br />
There oft pestilence and sickness<br />
Pay each other salutation,<br />
And unite their fatal efforts<br />
To destroy in deadly numbers,<br />
Raging through the streets in darkness,<br />
And disguis&eacute;d in the daytime<br />
To betray the one who thinks not<br />
That his doom is yet so near him.<br />
There the harlot of the midnight<br />
Holdeth forth her deadly charmings<br />
To entice the blind and simple.<br />
He is simple who doth lend her<br />
Such a glance that lusts go after;<br />
He defil&eacute;d that partaketh<br />
Of the couch she sheweth to him.<br />
Seek of wisdom, and refrain thee<br />
From the path whereon she lurketh;<br />
<!-- page 70--><a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>She will draw thy vigor from thee,<br />
And thy spirit to destruction.<br />
There is sin, in all its blackness,<br />
Spreading wide its vile infection.<br />
Like unto a thief it stealeth<br />
Through the crowded lanes and alleys;<br />
And appeareth, robed more gaily,<br />
Yet as hideous in its purpose,<br />
In the dwellings of the lofty,<br />
On their walks and promenadings.<br />
Here the young are led from virtue<br />
Unto every ill devising;<br />
As the lad who, in his anger,<br />
Curseth a reproving parent<br />
Daily wanders unto evil,<br />
Till his hand is raised to murder,<br />
Reeking in a brother&rsquo;s life-blood.<br />
Then of fear he is betaken,<br />
And a bloody spirit haunts him,<br />
Till his days are sadly ended<br />
Hanging on the loathsome gallows.<br />
Here is revel mirth and gladness,<br />
And gay scenes, where flock the simple.<br />
They are simple who, allur&eacute;d,<br />
Follow Pleasure&rsquo;s fleeting phantom.<br />
They are led deluded onward,<br />
<!-- page 71--><a name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
71</span>Till it is a curse unto them,<br />
And they have not power to leave it.<br />
They are led to low desires,<br />
Craving unto lust and evil;<br />
As the drunkard and profaner,<br />
As the vile and the licentious<br />
Glory in plebian language,<br />
With their sharp tongues dipt in slander,<br />
And their words in curses flowing,<br />
Think not of their awful ending<br />
Till destruction comes upon them.<br />
Thus the gorgeous devil hieth<br />
To the grand and gay assemblies,<br />
And attend him many pages<br />
In their many-colored costumes;<br />
They are eager at enlisting,&mdash;<br />
Luring numbers to his bondage.<br />
Have you taken his temptation?<br />
Are you too an eager worker<br />
To allure the simple to him?<br />
Say how many souls are writhing<br />
In a long and sad destruction,<br />
Who pursued a better pathway<br />
Till you lured them to forego it.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But I must not wander thuswise.<br />
We are now in the great city,<br />
<!-- page 72--><a name="page72"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
72</span>Where the lofty and the lowly,<br />
And the sumptuous and the starving,<br />
Are within each other&rsquo;s shadows.<br />
There the merchant and the trader<br />
Tendeth each his own transactions;<br />
Some deal fairly, some deal falsely.<br />
And the judges sit dispensing<br />
Seeming justice to the people;<br />
But their judgments are corrupted,<br />
And they rule in wrong or favor.<br />
There is constant din and bustle;<br />
And the weary shopman standeth<br />
Day to day in close confinement;<br />
And the pallid seamstress sitteth<br />
For a long and tedious twelve hours<br />
Stitching, while her life is ebbing<br />
In a rapid current from her.<br />
Now awhile we see the playhouse,<br />
And the giddy hall of music,<br />
And the scenes expos&eacute;d therein,<br />
Oft immodest and immoral.<br />
Next the nest of thieves and robbers,<br />
With their heaps of spoil and plunder,<br />
And their hidden laws and customs.<br />
Then we seek the house of prayer,<br />
Which is only weekly opened,<br />
<!-- page 73--><a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
73</span>Or which day to day inviteth<br />
Weary souls into its shadow,<br />
There to hold a sweet communion<br />
With the God who made and keeps them,<br />
Or the silent hours of midnight<br />
To employ in watchful prayer.<br />
As we come unto His presence<br />
Let us bow in holy reverence,<br />
As is ever due and fitting,<br />
To the God who there descendeth.<br />
Now behold the people gathered;<br />
They are all as one together,<br />
But their thoughts are widely parted.<br />
Some are earnest, true, and godly,<br />
Others wicked and regardless;<br />
Some are semi-sanctimonious,<br />
(Most obnoxious of deceivers.)<br />
Let us see their inward purpose.<br />
One doth offer true oblation&mdash;<br />
Praise and worship, as he seemeth;<br />
While the thoughts of one near by him<br />
Are among the world&rsquo;s pleasures;<br />
And another has come hither<br />
To give homage, style, and fashion;<br />
And another thinks of feasting<br />
(His great god is in his belly.)<br />
<!-- page 74--><a name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
74</span>Suchlike is the varied purpose<br />
Of the lofty and the humble,<br />
Met together and commingled<br />
In this sacred house of prayer.<br />
Now we leave this hallowed building,<br />
And again the street we enter.<br />
There we meet a mournful number,<br />
In a mournful measuring treading,<br />
All in sombre garments vested;<br />
And in reverent awe we follow<br />
To the place where sculls of dead men<br />
And the framework of the body<br />
In the grave&rsquo;s deep stillness slumber,&mdash;<br />
Where the worms are ever feeding<br />
On the bodies fast decaying.<br />
There the mourners lay their burden<br />
In the cold grave, weeping on it<br />
Tears of anguish deep and bitter;<br />
And they heap the mould upon it,<br />
And return a little season,<br />
Till the time for their departure:<br />
Soon in death they also slumber.<br />
Let us always keep as sacred<br />
This still dwelling of our fathers,<br />
Whereto oft the lonely mourner,<br />
Oft the orphan and the widow,<br />
<!-- page 75--><a name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
75</span>Come to weep a tear of sorrow<br />
On the cold ground which enshrineth<br />
The remains of dear ones parted<br />
Ever from their earthly presence.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we leave the crowded city,<br />
With its mingled good and evil,<br />
With its noise, and din, and bustle,<br />
And the roll of laden waggon,<br />
And the mail cart, and the black van;<br />
And we pass a little onward,<br />
Down beside the pleasant river,<br />
To the fields of war and bloodshed,<br />
Where destruction&rsquo;s storm is raging,<br />
Where the valiant and the brave men<br />
All around are thickly falling&mdash;<br />
Falling as the leaves of Autumn,<br />
Trampled in the dust around them,<br />
Where they soon will be forgotten,<br />
Sleeping in the depth of ages.<br />
Gory red the river runneth,<br />
And the plains with blood are steaming&mdash;<br />
Boiling blood, which from the wounded<br />
Floweth, gushing fast and freely.<br />
Why is all this ruthless ravage,<br />
And this people fiercely warring?<br />
It is for a vain ambition,<br />
<!-- page 76--><a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>Or a little earthly matter<br />
Which they cannot settle better<br />
Than in war and deadly bloodshed,<br />
Or to gain an angry vengeance<br />
For some insult which appeareth<br />
To imagination hideous.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now we leave the sterner presence<br />
Of the earth and all its changes,<br />
And we take the wings of fancy,<br />
(Which is sister to poesy),<br />
Guided by the light of record<br />
Thereon mount, and fly, surveying,<br />
Far above the heights of knowledge.<br />
And we take a retrospective<br />
Of the ancient times and people,<br />
When was nature young and blooming,<br />
When our fathers were created,<br />
And within the blessed Eden<br />
Set to tend and to adorn it.<br />
Adam with his Eve belov&eacute;d,<br />
Happy in their single nature,<br />
Thus brought forth to joy and pleasure,<br />
Innocent and sweet amusement,<br />
In attending on the fair wants<br />
Of the creatures set around them,<br />
Over which, in kingly greatness,<br />
<!-- page 77--><a name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
77</span>They were made the head, the purpose<br />
Of these others in creation,<br />
From the unexplor&eacute;d chaos.<br />
Thence we come into the present.<br />
Age to age doth bring us onward<br />
Through the fickle term of nations<br />
And the changes of the people,<br />
Mid their tumults and their tranquils,<br />
As they stand in pomp and glory,<br />
Firm and faithful in their own strength,<br />
Till its frailty cometh on them<br />
And they are completely conquered,&mdash;<br />
Broken down in great destruction.<br />
O&rsquo;er the waters of the deluge<br />
We come sailing onward, onward;<br />
And arrive with many records<br />
From the many downcast nations,<br />
From the people of all ages,<br />
First, and last, and intervening.<br />
And we pass the time allotted<br />
To the gods of superstition,<br />
When the world was set in darkness,<br />
In the fear of gods of fancy,<br />
Who held counsel on Olympus.<br />
There sat Jupiter, the greatest,<br />
On his ivory and gold throne,<br />
<!-- page 78--><a name="page78"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
78</span>And communed with his advisers,<br />
Who were Juno, his betroth&eacute;d,<br />
Fairest goddess of the council,<br />
Who gave from her depths of knowledge<br />
Good advisings to her chieftain.<br />
Then were Mars, the fierce and warlike,<br />
And Apollo, for the poets,<br />
With Diana, his twin sister,<br />
Who sat on the silent moonbeam,<br />
Chaste, enchanting in her meekness.<br />
Then stood Venus, rich in charmings,<br />
Goddess sole of love and beauty;<br />
And stood Mercury, the swiftest<br />
Bearer of the council&rsquo;s tidings.<br />
Then came Neptune, strong and mighty,<br />
Ruler of the storms and tempests;<br />
And the god of fire near him,<br />
Who was Vulcan, rude and ready.<br />
And to Vesta, Saturn&rsquo;s daughter,<br />
Were entrusted fires also,<br />
More refined and more celestial;<br />
While the number was completed<br />
By good Ceres, full of bounty,<br />
Keeper of the corns and harvests.<br />
Thus in council sat the great gods,<br />
Dealing fates unto the nations;<br />
<!-- page 79--><a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>So the simple people fancied.<br />
Now the flight of fancy over,<br />
She hath brought us safely homeward,<br />
To the spot we love the fondest.<br />
There we lay the many tokens<br />
Of the wondrous journey by us,<br />
And reflect now quaintly, calmly<br />
On the great things we have witnessed<br />
In this kingdom of Nim&aelig;ra;<br />
And, before our thoughts are settled,<br />
We by votaries are surrounded<br />
From the courts of every people,<br />
From the throne of every nation,<br />
Who, in tongues that widely vary,<br />
And in words that sound so strangely,<br />
Give their mission, bear their record<br />
Of the throne of King Nim&aelig;ra,<br />
Of his ancient power and greatness,<br />
Of his presence with the modern,<br />
With their people of the present.<br />
And to give its own conviction<br />
Shall the voice of every creature,<br />
Of the nobles of creation,<br />
All in one together mingle,<br />
From the feeble voice of old age<br />
To the lisping tongue of childhood.<br />
<!-- page 80--><a name="page80"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
80</span>Grand shall be their mingled accents,<br />
Which in verity are rising,<br />
Telling likewise of Nim&aelig;ra,<br />
Who their every purpose ruleth,<br />
Tends it in its first conception,<br />
Baffles wholly and destroys it,<br />
Or unto completion brings it,<br />
Bringeth out its faults or virtues,<br />
Shewing where its merit lieth.<br />
Then shall every beast that liveth,<br />
Every bird and every reptile,<br />
Every fish and every insect,<br />
Raise their own peculiar voices&mdash;<br />
(Terrible, or sweet, or puny);<br />
And will testify their own way<br />
Of the powers of King Nim&aelig;ra,<br />
Who their being&rsquo;s fire feedeth,<br />
Gives them space for life and glory,<br />
With that limit ends their being;<br />
For no hidden spirit have they<br />
Image to the holy Maker.<br />
Now the grave shall yield its token,<br />
And the battle-field its relic,<br />
Stained in gore and kept in glory;<br />
And the caverns of the ocean<br />
Shall advance a token likewise,<br />
<!-- page 81--><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
81</span>Opening wide their watery great doors,<br />
Shew the works of many ages<br />
By the hand of King Nim&aelig;ra,<br />
With the wonders stored among them,<br />
Worked, and fashioned, and perform&eacute;d.<br />
Then the voice of stormy Winter,<br />
And the soft and pleasing fair notes<br />
Of the Springtime and the Summer,<br />
And the richly-laden Autumn,<br />
Shall a ready answer make us.<br />
And the mighty wind that bloweth,<br />
And the soothing and the soft breeze<br />
With a pensive murmur cometh&mdash;<br />
Cometh laden with responses<br />
From the trees of every forest<br />
(Every leaflet&rsquo;s tiny voice joined),<br />
From the fair and fertile valleys,<br />
From among the hills and mountains,<br />
With advisings to speak boldly<br />
Of the powers of King Nim&aelig;ra;<br />
That in every race or ramble<br />
Has his throne been set around them,<br />
Built of wonders and compos&eacute;d<br />
Far amid the wilds and fertiles.<br />
Here and hence these heralds answer;<br />
Then they take their pinions swiftly,<br />
<!-- page 82--><a name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
82</span>And are vanished ere we know them,<br />
Still to roam, and race, and ramble.<br />
Next the voices shall be blended<br />
Of the brooklets and great rivers,<br />
Of the ever-murmuring ocean,<br />
Of the wild and roaring thunders,<br />
Of the tempest howling terrors,<br />
Hailstones heavy and great snow-storms,<br />
And the flames of fire roaring;<br />
These shall boldly say their saying,<br />
That he is among them alway,<br />
That they have for ever known him,<br />
And their strength dependeth on him.<br />
Then the rocks in echoes answer&mdash;<br />
Answer to the roll of thunders,<br />
And the roaring of the ocean,<br />
In a myriad sounds replying,<br />
Own the powers of King Nim&aelig;ra.<br />
Then the stars shall twinkle signs forth,<br />
Like the language of the speechless;<br />
And the sun in dazzling bright rays,<br />
And the moon with mellow fair beams,<br />
And the evening and the morning,<br />
And the noonday and the midnight,<br />
And the dew which gently falleth,<br />
And the raindrops and the vapors,<br />
<!-- page 83--><a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
83</span>And the mists on all the rivers,<br />
And the fleecy and the black clouds<br />
Shall inscribe their ready answers,<br />
And with mystic fingers write thus:<br />
&ldquo;When our buoyant pinions take us<br />
High unto the outer heavens,<br />
Far beyond the eagle&rsquo;s soarings,<br />
Then we see Nim&aelig;ra&rsquo;s wonders<br />
In all spaces that we visit<br />
On the earth or in the heavens,<br />
And, in every form that nears us,<br />
See his wondrous power and greatness;<br />
For his throne is firmly builded,<br />
Rising unto all the world.&rdquo;<br />
And they further shall inform us<br />
That some strange and mystic stories<br />
Have been spoken of Nim&aelig;ra<br />
And his dealings with the people,<br />
Counted in the ancient numbers,<br />
Reckoned in the current courses.<br />
Now that we are well inform&eacute;d<br />
Of his throne, and power, and dealings,<br />
Let us hear the voice of Reason,<br />
Speaking lastly, yet abounding<br />
Much of wisdom and of foresight,<br />
Seeing, as a prophet, matters<br />
<!-- page 84--><a name="page84"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
84</span>Hidden yet upon the future;<br />
And he tells us, &ldquo;Yet a short time<br />
Stands the throne of King Nim&aelig;ra;<br />
He but reigns a season longer,<br />
Then yields up his power and kingdom&mdash;<br />
Yields it to the hand which gave it;<br />
And he well hath filled his mission,&mdash;<br />
Ever faithful, ever constant.<br />
Now he steppeth from his high throne,<br />
Builded to the gates eternal,<br />
Which are quickly opened to him,<br />
And he joins the never ending.<br />
Then his kingdom is forgotten,<br />
And in flames as chaff consum&eacute;d,<br />
Rolled away as clouds of vapor;<br />
Clouds of smoke and clouds of vapor,<br />
Flying with the roar of thunders,<br />
Terrible, and loud, and mighty,<br />
And with lurid lights illuming<br />
All the vast unfathomed chaos.<br />
Then comes gloom and dismal darkness,<br />
Falling over all the spaces,<br />
When the flames forget their burning.<br />
Now his people come for judgment,<br />
And they are in substance spirits,<br />
Born to everlasting being.<br />
<!-- page 85--><a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>Mighty is the Judge who sitteth,<br />
And His throne a sea of splendor.<br />
He gives justice without favor.<br />
He is good, and kind, and gentle.<br />
They whose lives have been directed<br />
Just, and upright, and unswerving<br />
From the ways of truth, shall see Him<br />
With a joy of sweetest measure.<br />
He is stern and firm in purpose.<br />
They whose lives have been of evil<br />
Tremble in His awful presence;<br />
For they see their doom engraven,&mdash;<br />
&lsquo;To the pit of Long Damnation,&rsquo;<br />
Awful gloom and awful terrors.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The scene of this Poem is located on the banks of the Eden, a
pleasant river in Cumberland.&nbsp; It is founded on facts, but
the names and some other immaterial points are imaginary.</p>
<h3><!-- page 89--><a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span> LORD HENRY OF THE EDEN-SIDE.</h3>
<p>Roll, ye gentle waters,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rich in music laden;<br />
Know ye not of matters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hid in sorrow&rsquo;s deep den.<br />
Bloom, ye buxom beauties,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By this Eden river;<br />
Thine a gem of duties<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To attend it ever.<br />
Spread, ye fruitful valleys,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Drawing from it life-spring;<br />
Ye may cope with allies,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And a victor&rsquo;s song sing.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas by this Eden of the
northern land,<br />
Upon the fertile banks of the fair stream,<br />
Where nature&rsquo;s beauties to the noonday spread,<br />
And in the golden sunset sparkle more,<br />
As charm to charm is added ever new,<br />
Until the eye is weary to behold<br />
The bounty of the grandeur there contained,<br />
To watch the peaceful bosom of the stream<br />
<!-- page 90--><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
90</span>Sparkle, as with a thousand diamonds set;<br />
While softly moving, as by inward life<br />
Inspired, to guide it in the bidden course,<br />
As it glides on and onward to the firth;<br />
While in its rural bed the silver trout<br />
Runs pouting freely, darts from stone to stone,<br />
As of that sport it never should be sore.<br />
And from the banks, amid the sylvan brake,<br />
A life of melody is rising here and there<br />
From wood-wild songsters, which their glory take<br />
To mete a measure ever sweet and fair;<br />
As though the task were for a victory,<br />
And each endeavoured to advance its notes<br />
In sweetest sounds and fairest melody.<br />
&rsquo;Tis sweetly soothing to the weary mind,<br />
Which here hath turned a little time for rest.<br />
Amid this scene the happy swains delight<br />
To dwell, and draw the vigor of their life<br />
With all the fulness nature can supply,<br />
And every morn awake to new delights<br />
Robust and hale, and of a healthy mind,<br />
And so go forth to labor, and to take<br />
The fulness of the land they labor on,<br />
And in the meadows feed their favored kine,<br />
So full and ready that they low and long<br />
The maid with pails to ease the milky load.<br />
<!-- page 91--><a name="page91"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
91</span>Sweet is this scene in early hours when viewed,<br />
What time the rising sun comes proudly forth,<br />
Midway to east, between the south and north,<br />
And chases quick the lingering night away,<br />
Which, as a schoolboy, loiters on the way;<br />
Or in the tranquil of a closing day<br />
It is beheld in charms surpassing sweet,<br />
Just as the sun has done his bidden course,<br />
And goes to slumber in the favored west,<br />
Yet lingers long to take a parting look<br />
Upon the land which he shall leave behind,<br />
As seeming loth to wander from the scene,<br />
But, called of duty, moves at length away,<br />
And draws his train behind the distant hills,<br />
Till all is lost to the admiring gaze,<br />
Which feasted on the beauties to the last.<br />
For darkness comes with night, his paramour,<br />
And cast their shadows over all the land;<br />
And in their stilly presence creeps repose,<br />
And folds his arms around the lifeful sounds,<br />
Till all is hushed of nature into rest,<br />
And all the tuneful throng is mutely still,<br />
And comes no sound of labor from the hill.<br />
Then thrilling is the grandeur of the calm;<br />
The only sounds which come upon the ear,<br />
To tell the mind that life remaineth near,<br />
<!-- page 92--><a name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
92</span>Are the soft murmurings of the silvery stream,<br />
The gentle winds which whisper to the trees<br />
As they go wandering in the border woods,<br />
Or now and then the screeching of an owl,<br />
The bleeting lamb, or distant watch-dog&rsquo;s howl.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&rsquo;Twas on this scene Lord
Henry loved to dwell&mdash;<br />
A noble bearer of a noble name&mdash;<br />
Lured by the tranquil of a country home<br />
To muse upon the beauties of the land.<br />
&rsquo;Twas here the castle of his fathers stood&mdash;<br />
Time honored and of pleasing memories,<br />
Adorned of nature and of every art<br />
Which the devising of the mind can give<br />
To feed the fancy of admiring man.<br />
But in these pleasants soon there came a time<br />
When he got weary of the lonesome life,<br />
Which led him, day by day, in the same scenes,<br />
And did not still the longings of his soul.<br />
For now he felt the presence of a power<br />
Which all men feel, that moves the will at ease<br />
Unto a bondage which they fain would shun,<br />
Yet loving well the while the gentle guile<br />
Which bids the soul unto the presence sweet<br />
Of some fair maid, whose winning charms had wrought<br />
Well on the strongholds of a purposed heart,<br />
<!-- page 93--><a name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
93</span>Until the entrance hath been fully made,<br />
And it is captive to her choosing will,<br />
And all the forms to wedlock which pertain.<br />
This mystic power incited on him more,<br />
Till he resolved to seek a maiden fair,<br />
And share with her the blessings of his home,<br />
And mete with her the measure of his life.<br />
Thus said the voice which whispered to his soul:<br />
&ldquo;And she shall cheer me in the heavy hours,<br />
And give a spirit to my lonesome life;<br />
And she shall be a maiden, young, and fair,<br />
And gentle, and be termed the sweetest flower<br />
Of all the land for many measures round;<br />
And such a maiden I shall love, and serve,<br />
And honor, and revere, with all the love<br />
Which an admiring soul can give to one<br />
Who is the perfect image of his heart.&rdquo;<br />
And, ere a while, Lord Henry loved, and wooed,<br />
And wed a maiden of a worthy line,<br />
And led her gently to his country home,<br />
And us&eacute;d every power to make her glad,<br />
And loved and served her with a constant love,<br />
And had no mind to other than to her.<br />
For she was sweet, and fair, and gentle (more<br />
Than the bright picture he had fancied of);<br />
And they were happy in such tranquil joys,<br />
<!-- page 94--><a name="page94"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
94</span>As day by day went fleeting on its course,<br />
And saw them still in one united love,<br />
And one to one the source of sweetest joy.<br />
These bore their record ere they passed away<br />
Of some distinguished pleasure to imply&mdash;<br />
A sweetness to the retrospective thought.<br />
She was his sole companion day and night.<br />
Oft he would lead her to the flowery lawn,<br />
And in the rosy bowers bedeck her hair,<br />
And watch the image of his soul repose<br />
In all her beauty &rsquo;neath a rosy crown;<br />
Amid the fragrance of the blooming eve,<br />
And the soft cadence from the sylvan towers,<br />
Beheld the heaving of her gentle breast,<br />
Moved by the passing of a peaceful breath,<br />
Until of love his soul would overflow;<br />
Then he would bend and lay his lips to hers,<br />
And pour a shower of mellow kisses there.<br />
Then he loved well to hear the harp reply&mdash;<br />
The silvery harp&mdash;unto her nimble touch,<br />
And shower its floods of melody away,<br />
To mingle with the songs of nature by;<br />
For it knew well the softness of her touch,<br />
And gladly gave its music in return.<br />
But more he loved than music of the harp,<br />
Or songs of many valleys in the Spring,<br />
<!-- page 95--><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
95</span>When every fragment of the air is full<br />
Of song and all the arts of melody,<br />
To hear the sweetness of her full-tuned voice,<br />
Raised to the measure of some favored song;<br />
A life-like presence lending to the theme,<br />
Until the soul is fervent in return<br />
Of they who listen to its thrilling power.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they would wander to the village
oft,<br />
Now by the path along the bridge, and then<br />
Across the water by the ferry-boat;<br />
For the coy village is across the stream,<br />
Near on a line from where the castle stands,<br />
And nigh it well, that when the breeze accords,<br />
Or calm prevails, the sounds come floating o&rsquo;er<br />
Of mirthful lads in gambol on the green,<br />
Or the part song of buxom damsel raised,<br />
Who lightly busies at her noonday task;<br />
Anon the chime of the church clock, which tells<br />
Another hour departed of the year.<br />
And all these sounds familiar to them come,<br />
And all the village holds them in respect,<br />
Which as they near the rustic boys will doff<br />
Their brown worn caps in manner rustic like,<br />
While dame and damsel pay a reverence meet<br />
Unto the lady they have learnt to love;<br />
For she is loved by all the people well,<br />
<!-- page 96--><a name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
96</span>And held in honor as a God-sent friend,&mdash;<br />
Kind-hearted to the poor, and to the sick<br />
A double help and kindly comforter.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In manner thus the seasons quickly
pass,<br />
One after one,&mdash;the flowery Summer and<br />
The golden Autumn, with her bounty hand;<br />
Then, in the background, Winter, and again,<br />
When Spring, the early Summer; it was then,<br />
Her full time having come, the lady went<br />
Unto her chamber, and brought forth a child.<br />
And it was robed, and brought, and put into<br />
The father&rsquo;s hand, and he was very glad<br />
With the full joy which fills a father&rsquo;s heart,<br />
And went and kissed his wife, and bade<br />
Her speedy well, and all things seem&eacute;d good;<br />
And in his ear a sweet, soft voice foretold:<br />
&ldquo;Thine is a happy lot of years to come,<br />
All full of tranquil and domestic bliss;<br />
Thy paths are by the ways of harmony,<br />
And a fair train of love shall ever tend,<br />
With all her blessings largely to bestow,<br />
Upon thy head as dew in Summer night.&rdquo;<br />
Again he went unto his wife, to see<br />
How quickly she got well and how she fared<br />
For he was weary to be wanting her,<br />
And longed to see her graceful form again<br />
<!-- page 97--><a name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
97</span>Come quickly here and there about his home.<br />
But lo! he saw the hand of sickness had<br />
Upon his loved one laid a ruthless hold,<br />
And that the lustre of her eye had gone,<br />
And that her voice had lost its brightest chords.<br />
Then day and night he watched her, and bestowed<br />
Of every tendence he could think to give,<br />
Which would allay the fever, or imply<br />
Relief awhile unto her aching head.<br />
But day and night he saw her further wane,<br />
Her life-stream ebbing every hour away;<br />
Until at last he saw her wane and die,<br />
Beheld her sink into the arms of death.<br />
Then woeful was the scene, to see him bend<br />
Upon the lifeless form in floods of woe,<br />
Whose bitter torrents overwhelm&eacute;d long;<br />
And much he wept in full and heavy tears,<br />
Till they who saw it thought his heart would break;<br />
And for long hours he gazed upon her form,<br />
Nor could conceive that she was truly dead.<br />
And all the household wept, and many came<br />
To give him comfort, but he turned away,<br />
And could not hearken to their kindly words,<br />
And rose and left the house to wander out,<br />
And passed the old domestic at the door,<br />
Who dare not question where his master went.<br />
<!-- page 98--><a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>And to the woods he wandered.&nbsp; It was night,<br />
And long the warblers of the dale had sung<br />
Their last glad anthem to the dying day,<br />
And gone to slumber in the sylvan bowers<br />
Until the dawning of another morn.<br />
And on he wandered, but he knew not whence,<br />
For all his thoughts were maddened and confused.<br />
Then to the bower he came, where oft in time<br />
But lately gone he had his loved one led,<br />
And with the fairest flowers bedecked her hair.<br />
He paused awhile, and, with a heavy sigh,<br />
Spake to the flowers, &ldquo;O ye fair flowers, receive<br />
The lamentations of a widowed heart.<br />
Thy gay perfections have no further charms;<br />
And those sweet odors are diffus&eacute;d now<br />
As fragrance is unto a wasted land,<br />
Since she who loved them has for ever gone.&rdquo;<br />
Then on he pressed into the deepest depths<br />
Of the still woods, his mournful story told<br />
In tears and sighs unto the woods and wilds;<br />
And they made answer in a murmur deep,<br />
Which ran from tree to tree adown the break;<br />
While from the stream a low lamenting came,<br />
And the clear heavens wept gentle tear-drops down,<br />
And every star seemed as a pitying eye&mdash;<br />
An eye of love with sparkling tear-drops full.<br />
<!-- page 99--><a name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
99</span>And all around was mute, and the pale moon<br />
Came forth to take a survey of her realm,<br />
Parading in a calm majestic air<br />
From end to end, and casting here and there,<br />
Through the condenseness of the sylvan boughs,<br />
Her sidelong glances, which intrude the depths,<br />
And lay strange shadows wrangling on the ground.<br />
Then for a while he stood amazed amid<br />
The awful tremor of this death-like calm,<br />
And for a time his grief forgot its depth;<br />
For a calm wonder sat enthroned instead<br />
Upon his soul, which shewed the great, and good,<br />
And grand conception of the God who made<br />
The earth and heavens in order so profound.<br />
And, growing weary, there he sat him down<br />
Beneath the cover of a spreading tree;<br />
For it was many days since he had slept<br />
Or rested for his earnest watchfulness.<br />
He breathed a silent prayer that God would send<br />
Him comfort in and strength to bear the grief,<br />
Then drew his mantle o&rsquo;er him, and remained<br />
Wrapt in the sadness of his mournful thoughts,<br />
Until the gentle arms of slumber closed<br />
Around him, and he slept a deep, soft sleep.<br />
And in the watches of the night there came<br />
A bright and wondrous vision on his mind.<br />
<!-- page 100--><a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>He dreamt that on a lovely eve he sat<br />
Beneath the shadow of a spreading tree,<br />
In adoration of the beauties round<br />
But heartsore with the burden of his woe;<br />
When the sweet fragments of a heavenly song<br />
Broke on his ear.&nbsp; He raised his eyes, and lo!<br />
Amid the tranquil heights above he saw<br />
Forth from the portals of the eternal gates<br />
Two angel forms descending unto him.<br />
Their garments were as white as Winter snow,<br />
And on their brows were sparkling crowns of gold,<br />
And they had wings as angels, and each held<br />
A banner in her hand, on which these words<br />
In golden letters were so strangely wrought:<br />
&ldquo;&rsquo;Tis peace, and love, and joy eternally<br />
Adorns the precincts of our blessed home.&rdquo;<br />
And bright their presence was as dazzling suns,<br />
Which send a radiance through the heavens wide.<br />
They now before him stood, and she who spake<br />
Was lovely to behold; her perfect form<br />
Was as the form of his departed one,<br />
Yet lovelier far; and the sweet voice did seem<br />
The same sweet voice he had been wont to hear.<br />
In fervent power, yet softly, thus she spake:<br />
&ldquo;Dear Henry, rise and mourn no more for me,<br />
Since I am in a sweet eternity,<br />
<!-- page 101--><a name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>And dwell in peace, and joy, and love, and songs,<br />
Which are for ever gladly rising there.<br />
Sweet were our days together spent below,<br />
But sweeter far they shall be when above<br />
We are united through unending days<br />
With her, an angel too, who was our babe,<br />
And who hath come to bear me presence here.&rdquo;<br />
Then by the hand she took him, and thus spake<br />
In kind and pleading words: &ldquo;The laws of man<br />
Would hold and deem it just that, if a man<br />
In time of his prosperity forget<br />
To render to his God a full return<br />
Of thankfulness and praise, then he shall be<br />
In time of his adversity forgot.<br />
But God is more compassionate, and says<br />
That if a man turn from his heedless ways,<br />
And bear a true repentance, he shall live.<br />
Then I, the spirit of your once fond wife,<br />
Come from the realms of bliss, do thee adjure;<br />
Turn to thy God, and give Him worship due,<br />
And mourn not with a needless sorrow more.<br />
Then, but a season longer, ye shall come<br />
And join me in this never-ending bliss.&rdquo;<br />
Awe-struck and dumb the wondering Henry stood,<br />
And took communion from the Holy One;<br />
In adoration bound, he knew not whence<br />
<!-- page 102--><a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>To make an answer fit, and would have knelt,<br />
Like as before a God, to worship them.<br />
But, ere he knew, they had on pinions bright<br />
Resumed their course unto the regions whence<br />
He saw them come; and, with a wondering look,<br />
He watched them still ascend, until the gates<br />
Of heaven opened, and they entered in.<br />
Then it was morn, and Henry woke from sleep,<br />
And looked in wonder on the things around,<br />
And felt bewildered for a time to know<br />
How hither he had come, and whence the cause.<br />
Then fragments of the dream broke on his mind,<br />
And yet awhile the joys, the cares, the woes<br />
Came clear in their intensity, as when<br />
He had endured them in the days just gone.<br />
The chilly numbness from his limbs removed,<br />
He turned to wander homeward, being now<br />
Refreshed by sleep and more in spirit soothed,<br />
Reflecting long and deep on the stern truths<br />
And troubles tending on the lives of men.<br />
Then came the vision of the night before<br />
Clear as the waters of a Summer stream,<br />
And bore its beauties to his soul anew,<br />
Wherefrom he saw a lucent line ascend,<br />
Of comfort and of warning to his life,<br />
Bidding his soul to higher things ascend,<br />
<!-- page 103--><a name="page103"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
103</span>As vapors rise&mdash;as vapors rise and flow&mdash;<br
/>
To seek the presence of the sunny heights,<br />
Sore of their sojourn in the sphere below;<br />
And thus reflected on his bygone days:<br />
&ldquo;Ah me! ah me! my latter life hath been<br />
A sorry semblance of the lives of men,<br />
Who seek for pleasures in a barren land,<br />
And look for comfort in an empty urn,<br />
And lose the aim wherefore they live and die<br />
Amid the luring of deluding joys.<br />
O error bold! ye now thyself reveal<br />
Within the chaos of departed time,<br />
That she, my wife, received the honor due<br />
Unto my God, for she was as my God,&mdash;<br />
The idol I adored, my constant theme.<br />
Forget! forgive!&nbsp; I will return again<br />
Unto a nobler purpose, and will give<br />
Unto my God the reverence which is meet,<br />
And yet a cherished recollection hold,<br />
Because of her who hath departed, and<br />
Who came to warn me of my error here.<br />
Then in a future day I shall ascend,<br />
And share beside her an eternal joy.&rdquo;<br />
Again he thought, &ldquo;But can the babe be dead?<br />
It which should be my only comfort now.<br />
But now I cannot murmur; I will say,<br />
<!-- page 104--><a name="page104"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
104</span>&lsquo;God&rsquo;s will be done!&rsquo;&nbsp; He
knoweth what is good.&rdquo;<br />
In manner thus he pondered full and deep,<br />
Until the hall he reached, then entered in.<br />
And all the household wondered whence he came,<br />
For that their lord had been the night away,<br />
But none could ask him whither he had been;<br />
And when they told him that the child was dead,<br />
For it was sickly ere he wandered forth,<br />
He shed a silent tear, and calmly said,<br />
&ldquo;Great are my woes, but I can bear them now.&rdquo;<br />
And &rsquo;twas the vision of the fallen night<br />
That stood a comfort to his spirit then;<br />
Yet he had hoped to see the child survive,<br />
And be a last lone comfort to his soul<br />
Of earthly kind.&nbsp; And they were glad to see<br />
That the full torrent of his grief had gone,<br />
And that a peaceful sadness moved him now.<br />
Then on the fifth day from her death it was,<br />
All due obsequies made, the castle gates<br />
Were opened, and emerged therefrom, in deep<br />
And sombre black, a mournful train, which bore<br />
Unto the grave the mother and the child.<br />
There in the ancients&rsquo; tombs they were reposed<br />
Together, by the graves where many years<br />
Had slept his fathers in a silent sleep.<br />
The old church bell tolled mournfully, and all<br />
<!-- page 105--><a name="page105"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
105</span>The village mourned, while many wept among<br />
The aged and the feeble, who had known<br />
The kindness of her way, and the full hand<br />
With which in trouble she had come to them.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Henry rose, and left the well-loved
spot,<br />
Nor could he brook to linger on the scene,<br />
Where had been spent so many happy hours<br />
With her he loved, and where she lived and died;<br />
But in a foreign land he sought a home,<br />
And there sojourn&eacute;d many years away.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto His throne.<br />
And thus the angel came and went;<br />
But they who by the pillow bent<br />
Were not the power of vision lent<br />
To see the holy being sent<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among them then,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And moving when<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He passed away,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Felt not the soft zephyrs lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Room for his wing,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 114--><a
name="page114"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 114</span>Heard not
the heavenly throng<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their glad anthem sing,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Till the fulness of their song<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Made the high arches
ring.</p>
<h3>THE LAST FAREWELL.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I remember<br />
Her long, lingering look,&mdash;<br />
The last farewell I took,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Returning from home.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Twas early September,<br />
The cornfields looked yellow,<br />
And garden fruits mellow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Were beginning to come.<br />
She came to the gate with me,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And faltered, &ldquo;Farewell!&rdquo;<br />
But oh! it was a hard one;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The silent tear fell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Down from her eye.<br />
Merrily the birds sang,<br />
But in her heart rang<br />
A more sorrowful lay,<br />
As she saw me away,<br />
Watching the turn<br />
Where ripples the burn,<br />
<!-- page 115--><a name="page115"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
115</span>Till I had gone past;<br />
And this was the last&mdash;<br />
The last of farewells.<br />
Oh how Time tells<br />
His wonderful power,<br />
So stern in the hour!</p>
<h3>REFLECTIONS.</h3>
<p>Low the flowing crops bent,<br />
With their fulness content;<br />
And many a sickle was sent<br />
Into the rustling fields,<br />
While the gay reaper wields<br />
The bounty which God yields<br />
&nbsp; In his goodness to man.<br />
But as I heard these reapers sing,<br />
Thought not Death&rsquo;s reaper would bring<br />
&nbsp; To me sorrow so soon;<br />
Thought not he would come and remove<br />
The one dearest object of love,<br />
&nbsp; The earth&rsquo;s greatest boon,<br />
From my presence away.<br />
Hallowed shall be that day,<br />
In memory alway<br />
Most dear unto me;<br />
<!-- page 116--><a name="page116"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
116</span>For, though I did not see<br />
&nbsp; The angel of death near,<br />
She may have seen<br />
&nbsp; His sable garments peer<br />
From the long ranks of time,<br />
And heard his voice chime,<br />
&ldquo;I shall come to bring thee<br />
Unto eternity.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead! dead!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh! bid<br />
My trembling heart be still.<br />
It cannot brook this ill;<br />
This strange and burdened truth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It cannot bear.<br />
The brightness of my youth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It chills to hear.<br />
&nbsp; Ah me! and has she gone,<br />
Who in sickness watched me long,<br />
Smoothed my pillow, hushed the throng,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And said<br />
&nbsp; To childhood&rsquo;s fears, &ldquo;Begone!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Who in error chid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And would gently bid<br />
A rising rage be still,<br />
Or check a stubborn will,<br />
In childhood seeming ill.<br />
<!-- page 117--><a name="page117"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
117</span>I think I see her now<br />
(The smile upon her brow)<br />
Sit in the woody shade,<br />
Adown the rural glade,<br />
&nbsp; So full in song.<br />
And watch her fondled boy,<br />
With some much cherished toy,<br />
&nbsp; Run raptured long.<br />
Ah yes! too truly she hath gone.<br />
&nbsp; The vacant seat to fill<br />
There is none other, there is none<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To take her place.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A mother lost<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Is ever most<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A home can bear.<br />
Can time never more<br />
That image restore?<br />
Has that voice gone to keep<br />
Its long silent sleep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the dead in the grave?<br />
She whom God hath said<br />
Should have reverence paid,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Here on the earth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All of her birth,<br />
Called to give honor,<br />
Long life the donor,<br />
<!-- page 118--><a name="page118"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
118</span>God hath said shall have.<br />
Dead, they all tell me.<br />
&nbsp; So strange, it doth seem<br />
Like a vision befel me&mdash;<br />
&nbsp; A wonderful dream,<br />
That I no more may breathe<br />
&nbsp; That name ever dear,<br />
Save in a mournful voice<br />
Hushed silent in fear.</p>
<h3>THE FUNERAL.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now the old church bell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tolls forth its death knell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mournfully to tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The hour has come at last,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In heavy sadness past,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To bury the dead,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in silence bid.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the mourners go,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All mournfully slow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Every heart beating low<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The march of the dead.<br />
All with soft and gentle tread<br />
Unto the sepulchre sped,<br />
And humbly bent every head,<br />
Bearing to her last home the dead,<br />
<!-- page 119--><a name="page119"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
119</span>In all the obsequies due;<br />
Every follower, in presence true,<br />
Many a well-known neighbour view,<br />
Paying his last meet respect<br />
Unto her who has gone,<br />
And whose remembrance shone<br />
Bright in the memory of them.<br />
Now through the old town they pace&mdash;<br />
The good old familiar place,<br />
Where often in time before<br />
She, in life&rsquo;s abounding store,<br />
Passed by many a friendly door.<br />
But now, how changed is the scene!<br />
She, cold in death&rsquo;s awful sheen,<br />
Is borne unto the still hallowed green.<br />
Every passer turns to see,<br />
And they say, &ldquo;Who can it be?&rdquo;<br />
And they ponder in the thought&mdash;<br />
One more unto death brought.<br />
Soon may we, too, soon be sought.<br />
But they who her in life knew<br />
Feel the truth more strangely true,<br />
And they take a sadder view<br />
Of the great loss to the few,<br />
Who received the bosom love<br />
Which her kind deeds went to prove.<br />
<!-- page 120--><a name="page120"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
120</span>Now they tread in the hallowed ground,<br />
Where the sons of ages have found<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Together a home.<br />
And they pause by the chosen ground,<br />
And all, in a silence profound,<br />
Hear the words of comfort flow,<br />
In deep power, sadly and low,<br />
From the messenger of love,<br />
Appointed of God above<br />
To tell to His people peace,<br />
And from care a glad release;<br />
And his words of comfort are<br />
Sweeter to their hearts by far<br />
Than balm to a seething wound.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now they lay<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the cold clay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To moulder away,<br />
All that is mortal of her.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O grave! receive her;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ye have no terror,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But to relieve her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A world of woe.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis but a season,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Waiting in reason,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shall be there.<br
/>
<!-- page 121--><a name="page121"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
121</span>She hath gone down corruptible,<br />
But shall rise incorruptible,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Adorn&eacute;d and
fair,<br />
When this grave which is clos&eacute;d<br />
Shall again be disclos&eacute;d,<br />
And the Good Shepherd shall call<br />
Together unto Him all<br />
His people, faithful and good,<br />
Who in life steadfast have stood.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O widower! weep not,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, orphans, lament not.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Weep not by the cold grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Long not that ye might have<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her with
you again;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But let
her remain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alone in the grave,<br />
In the peace of her last long abode.<br />
Far sweeter is death unto her now.</p>
<h3>AFTER THE BURIAL.</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All hath been finished now;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And from the darkened brow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the grave the people move,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pondering his own heart to prove,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each unto
his home.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 122--><a

the old dead&rsquo;s demesne<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hallowed
fancies come,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Living and clear, urgent and fain,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they visit in thought again<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And again the place where remain<br />
Their fathers, the sons of many ages,<br />
Gathered from the ever-turning pages<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of the volume of time,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Like a long running rhyme&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Old age
and youth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Falsehood
and truth,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beauty and
pride<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Side unto
side<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In that
old churchyard,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the
sacred guard<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of
hallowed rest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then a
behest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moveth the
breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be holy
and meek,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lowly to
seek<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Life unto
life,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bearing
through strife<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unto the
end,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Trying to
blend<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Love unto
life.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of every
breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they turn from the grave,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bordered in a wave<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of melancholy deep.<br

But their woe is not as our woe<br />
In fervor or depth; they cannot know<br />

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gates of heaven are opened,
and, behold,<br />
The herald comes upon the wings of night,<br />
When men in slumber lie, and when abroad<br />
The robber goes to plunder what he can;<br />
And when the lusty have gone forth to cull<br />
A night&rsquo;s defilement in an evil way;<br />
The gambler sitteth at his dizzy game,<br />
The sotted drunkard feeds his bestial thirst,<br />
And revel dancers are aloud in mirth.<br />
Alike the heedless and the godly sleep,<br />
When from the herald&rsquo;s waking trumpet comes<br />
The awful and sonorous cadence, which<br />
Shall roll around the earth from pole to pole&mdash;<br />
More grand, more great, and more tremendous than<br />
The voice of terror in the stormy sky,<br />
As when a thousand thunders war therein<br />
An angry war among the heavy clouds.<br />
And at the sound the wicked tremble sore,<br />
For now they know an awful doom at hand,<br />
And quail to find no rescue from its power.<br />
The robber drops the plunder from his hand;<br />
<!-- page 130--><a name="page130"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
130</span>The lusty startle at the mighty sound,<br />
And from their beds of sin turn wildly forth;<br />
And from his game the gambler leaps amazed<br />
And terror-struck; whereas the drunkard wakes&mdash;<br />
The sotted drunkard&mdash;from his stupid sleep,<br />
And feels the awful terrors of the hour.<br />
But by the righteous is the sound received<br />
As the glad tidings which they long have sought;<br />
For well they know the glory of the sign,<br />
When He, their true Deliverer, shall come.<br />
The earth shall tremble and rebound, and all<br />
The graves shall ope their darkened mouths, until<br />
The long-forgotten dead shall come therefrom.<br />
Then He who is the Judge appears forth from<br />
The heavenly gates; upon the lurid flame<br />
His chariot shall roll, and on the clouds<br />
Of sable smoke, down through the stormy sky,<br />
Where roar tremendous thunders, mid the cries<br />
Of agony and fear, which rise anon,<br />
Heartrending, from the lost, in anguish sore,<br />
Who call for shelter, but have no reply,<br />
Save terrors still more awful than before;<br />
Who seek for mercy, when their fearful doom<br />
Shall echo in their ear, &ldquo;Too late! too late!&rdquo;<br />
Then all the earth shall be engrossed in flame<br />
From sea to sea, and high the lurid glare<br />
<!-- page 131--><a name="page131"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

And the great waters, laving on the flame<br />
Their boiling waves, shall feed its power ten times,<br />
And lend their vapors to the burning air.<br />
All things shall be consumed excepting man;<br />
And through the flames the righteous shall be led<br />
Unhurt, as though there were no flame; whereas<br />
The wicked shall of tortures be conceived<br />
More deep in power than ever known before.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then on His throne, mid glories so
immense,<br />
The Judge in dreadful majesty appears,<br />
And looks in thrilling calm on all around.<br />
And on His brow sits equity enthroned,<br />
And truth and love united with it there;<br />
So radiant is His presence that, unveiled,<br />
The eye is dazzled which upon it dwells.<br />
He calls before Him all the people, and<br />
Discerns between the evil and the good<br />
Of all the deeds which they have done, and weighs<br />
Together in a balance, one in one,<br />
The evil and the good of all their thoughts,<br />
And all their words and mingled purposes.<br />
Then they to whom the balance falls to ill<br />
Their judgment thus receive: &ldquo;Depart, depart<br />
Unto the burning lake, for ever fed.<br />
Ye would not hearken to the warning words,<br />
<!-- page 132--><a name="page132"></a><span class="pagenum">p.

/>
Then to the hell eternal they and all<br />
The tortures of the world, and fears, and pains,<br />
And lust and anger, malice and disdain,<br />
And pride, and pomp, and every evil thought,<br />
Shall roll together, in a burning mass,<br />
Down deeper, deeper to the yawning gulphs.<br />
Thus all the mountains and great hills shall fly;<br />
And seas, and lakes, and rivers of the earth<br />
Shall vanish as a cloud before the wind;<br />
And He who was the Judge shall now ascend,<br />
Together with His chosen people, high<br />
Unto the heavenly gates, and, entering in,<br />
Shall have abode through day that knows no end<br />
In an Elysium of unmeasured joy.</p>
<h2><!-- page 135--><a name="page135"></a><span

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetest and fairest of the days
that dawn<br />
Upon Elysian hill, and over lawn,<br />
And field, and city spread a roseate light!<br />
The morning of the Sabbath day&mdash;in dight<br />
Of many a hallowed strain it comes.&nbsp; The bell<br />
Of every village o&rsquo;er the plain doth tell,<br />
From its high seat, within the sacred tower<br />
Above the house of God, from hour to hour,<br />
A joyous song; and in cathedral town<br />
The gladsome peals break forth and warble down;<br />
While through the city every belfrey gives<br />
A glad reply, which seems to say, &ldquo;He lives!<br />
He lives!&rdquo;&nbsp; The song of praise is heard ascend,<br />
Raised to the heavenly throne, in one to blend<br />
With angels&rsquo; song, from many a cottage rung,<br />
Where on this day the father with his young<br />
Sits down in peace; while, in the pine grove down<br />
The rural glen, a myriad voices crown<br />
The clear-tuned solo of the warbling thrush,<br />
Or oft in chorus to a duet flush,<br />
Sung with the full-piped blackbird of the wood,<br />
<!-- page 136--><a name="page136"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
136</span>Their notes are joined.&nbsp; The aspect and the
mood<br />
Of everything is changed, as wont on day<br />
Of toil the crowded city moves to lay<br />
The bands of slumber for a time away,<br />
But brings not out the bustle and the din<br />
Which is her weekday aspect; and within<br />
Her walls a stilly peace prevails; the roar<br />
And noise of lumbering waggon comes no more<br />
Along the well-worn street, nor busy tread<br />
Of envoy, hurrying on, by duty led,<br />
To bank, or warehouse, or to court of law.<br />
The myriad sounds have ceased, which nature saw<br />
Were fit to wait upon the day of toil;<br />
Nor mendicant nor ballad beggar foil<br />
The sacred rest with their assiduous song.<br />
And round the factory door the noisy throng<br />
Forgets to come as on the other days;<br />
Aside her task the weary seamstress lays,<br />
Now from the close and foul-aired workroom free.<br />
The toilsome shop is closed, and also he<br />
Who for the week stood there doth taste the sweets<br />
Of liberty awhile; the penman meets<br />
No more the tiring scroll; and now in chain<br />
The prisoner sits within his dungeon, wan<br />
And weary; but he hears some soothing strain<br />
Break through the thick and iron-girded wall;<br />
<!-- page 137--><a name="page137"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
137</span>And then the heavy shackles seem to fall<br />
From off his feet; a strange emotion fills<br />
His soul, and through his wasted body thrills,<br />
When of the bygone days he thinks in sweet<br />
And lingering thought; and then his eyes to meet<br />
The scanty rays are turned, and on his mind<br />
Awhile the captive fate forgets to find<br />
Its deepest force or weary sigh to send.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Turn from the city, and to country
lend<br />
A passing thought.&nbsp; All labor is at rest.<br />
The plough lies set, point in the mottled breast<br />
Of half-tilled field; the flail is laid above<br />
The barn&rsquo;s brown wall; the shining sickles move<br />
Not from their keep; the woodman&rsquo;s axe is still;<br />
The golden sheaf doth not the feeder fill;<br />
The huntsman&rsquo;s horn is hung behind the door;<br />
The delver&rsquo;s spade stands idle on the floor;<br />
The horse and oxen run the open field,<br />
Set free to graze; the holloaing drivers wield<br />
No whip or goad, and all the swain is free;<br />
The laborer walks abroad, and turns to see,<br />
With favoring look, the toilings of his hand,<br />
And fruits of labor rising from the land;<br />
The rustic lovers saunter in the fields,<br />
To talk of love and reap the joy it yields.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tower-clock now the worship-hour
relates,<br />
<!-- page 138--><a name="page138"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
138</span>And every church the worshipper awaits.<br />
Then thither come the cottar and his wife,<br />
(Once fair, now furrowed with the cares of life,)<br />
With sons and daughters; and, behind them near,<br />
The jovial farmer and his wife appear.<br />
Then comes the county squire; till the seats,<br />
One after one, are full.&nbsp; Then shortly meets<br />
The people&rsquo;s eager eye the tranquil face<br />
Of their beloved pastor, in his place.<br />
He kneels to God, and in deep fervour prays<br />
A sweet and powerful prayer; then he lays<br />
The open Bible down, and well expounds<br />
The message of the Saviour&rsquo;s love, till bounds,<br />
For truths so hallowed, every tending heart<br />
In joy.&nbsp; Then praise is sung; a ready part<br />
Takes every voice to raise a worthy song,<br />
Which breaks from seat to seat the aisle along.<br />
Then kneel the people by the throne of grace<br />
To take the blessing, ere they part to pace<br />
Again the world&rsquo;s besetting path.&nbsp; It falls<br />
Among them like as dew upon the palls<br />
Of parch&eacute;d flowers, to raise and nourish in<br />
The hour of need the vital spark within.</p>
<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sweetest and fairest, hallowed
day of rest!<br />
&ldquo;Peace&rdquo; is thy banner and thy mottoed crest&mdash;<br
/>
<!-- page 139--><a name="page139"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
139</span>An open boon to all.&nbsp; The weary wait&mdash;<br />
The weary wait and sigh to see the gate<br />
Of dawn admit thee forth in eastern sky.<br />
The merchant&rsquo;s daughter, as each morn goes by,<br />
Looks on the scenes without, and counts the days<br />
That fly&mdash;six, five, four, three, two, one&mdash;and lays<br
/>
A hopeful joy upon the day to come,<br />
When she shall by her father sit, and some<br />
Inspiring volume read, or, in a walk<br />
Through wood or vale, employ the time in talk,<br />
Sweet and instructively.&nbsp; The widow waits<br />
To see her son come home, and anxious gets<br />
When near the hour has drawn that she shall hear<br />
The step of her sole comforter draw near,<br />
With whom on earth she findeth sweetest joy.<br />
The orphans wait, and every night employ<br />
A time in prayer, that God be pleased to spare<br />
Their elder brother, and bestow him fair<br />
And happy days.&nbsp; They long the Sabbath day;<br />
For then he comes among them, and doth lay<br />
A cheerful spirit to the humble home;<br />
Pure and delicious truths he tells them from<br />
A flowing heart, and they all love him well.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All people love the Sabbath&mdash;they
who dwell<br />
In early years of innocence and joy,<br />
And they of lusty prime, whom cares employ<br />
<!-- page 140--><a name="page140"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
140</span>A thousand snares to tangle or to stem.<br />
But more than all, the Sabbath is to them<br />
A day of sweet delight who totter near<br />
The precincts of the grave without a fear&mdash;<br />
Yea, rather, with a joyous hope ere long<br />
To leave the weary ranks they now belong,<br />
Of feeble age, and, passing death&rsquo;s dark throng,<br />
Attain the kingdom of eternal song.</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of late stood Time amid the
scenes of life,<br />
With hoary locks and beard of silvery grey,<br />
And furrows deep upon his sage-like brow.<br />
Beside him was a dial of huge size,<br />
Whereby he shewed the minutes as they grew<br />
To hours, and days, and years in silent haste.<br />
He was in wistful mood, and, while I saw,<br />
Did point his finger to the midnight hour.<br />
&rsquo;Twas in a dream this wondrous scene appeared,<br />
Or in that stupor which is known between<br />
The rule of sleep and wake, when neither claim<br />
The power of holding a supreme command,<br />
Which may be call&rsquo;d half slumber and half wake.<br />
Morpheus had drawn his stilly presence nigh,<br />
And hush&rsquo;d all things into a calm profound.<br />
A thousand wondrous thoughts upon my mind,<br />
In order unaccounted, had gone by.<br />
Then as they passed a striking vision came;<br />
&rsquo;Twas bright and lucent as the early dawn,<br />
Which pays obeisance to a smiling morn.<br />
The stage of life was there before me set;<br />
<!-- page 144--><a name="page144"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
144</span>The curtain rose, and on it I beheld<br />
A maiden fair, the foremost in the act.<br />
Her mien was noble, and she held erect<br />
A form which was in Beauty&rsquo;s garb arrayed.<br />
Her eye was sparkling as the morning dew,<br />
And full of language&mdash;full that it o&rsquo;erflowed.<br />
Her teeth were white and pure as Winter snow;<br />
I saw them peer between her cherry lips,<br />
As these were moving in a gracious smile,<br />
Which traced her features like a silvery stream,<br />
And ran from view adown her dove-like neck.<br />
Her cheek was blooming as a new-blown rose;<br />
A modest flush came o&rsquo;er it as she stood.<br />
Her voice was sweet like music on the air,<br />
Thrown from a harp touched by a fairy sprite;<br />
And in her look a happy tranquil dwelt.<br />
Bound with the crown of virtue which she wore<br />
Upon her brow (a diadem of gems)<br />
Were the sweet flowers of purity, which gave<br />
A charm more sweet than all the rest to see.<br />
In short, she was perfection&rsquo;s perfect choice,<br />
And Beauty&rsquo;s fairest child of all the group<br />
Of Eve&rsquo;s unnumbered daughters, who abide,<br />
Or have abode, amid these mingled scenes.<br />
&rsquo;Twas now the season of her noonday prime,<br />
Wherein she might have gloried if she would;<br />
<!-- page 145--><a name="page145"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
145</span>But the calm spirit which within her moved<br />
Would not allow like vanities to rise.<br />
Amid the lucent streams of mellow light,<br />
Which showered its fullest softness down on her,<br />
She stood&mdash;the beauteous maiden stood adored.<br />
To see the gay perfection of her charms<br />
Came wonder, peering forth; for he was lured<br />
With an intense delight to see a form<br />
Clothed and adorned in such simplicity,<br />
Yet of unbounded elegance the while.<br />
And far her fame had spread throughout the land.<br />
Then soon from town and city numbers came,<br />
And from the quiet of their country homes,<br />
To cast their admiration at her feet;<br />
For they had longed with their own eyes to see<br />
Her nymph-like form, and with their ears to hear<br />
The music of her voice, and for themselves<br />
To read the language of her sparkling eye.<br />
And many sought to win her as his own;<br />
And to her shrine they brought rich offerings all,<br />
Each of the best and choicest of his stores.<br />
And she beheld the riches which they brought,<br />
And heard the words of flattery which they bore,<br />
And marked the attentions lavished unto her,<br />
But gave no heed to these, and deemed them all<br />
As idle and deluding vanities;<br />
<!-- page 146--><a name="page146"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
146</span>For she beheld they sought the outward charms,<br />
But minded not the treasures of the heart,<br />
Which are more precious than all other gain.<br />
So she did make, in firm yet kindly words,<br />
An answer of refusal unto each,<br />
And held her from them in discreet reserve.<br />
Erewhile another came, whom she beheld<br />
Sought more the secret worth than outward charms,<br />
And that he was in every purpose fair,<br />
And just and honorable, true and good,<br />
And that he brought no dazzling gifts to tempt<br />
Her with, that he might win her heart and hand.<br />
And he in silent heed did note awhile<br />
Her nature and the ordering of her ways,<br />
And was much pleased to see them ordered well,<br />
And that the beauties of a virtuous mind<br />
Were not extinguished by her outward charms,<br />
As is, alas! the case too frequently.<br />
Then from this admiration yet awhile<br />
Did rise a love fair and reciprocal;<br />
And in due course he sought her heart and hand,<br />
And she did yield them gladly unto him.<br />
Thus they were in the bonds of wedlock joined,<br />
To mete the measure of their lives in one;<br />
And in their home was harmony and peace,<br />
And in all things they were together true.<br />
<!-- page 147--><a name="page147"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
147</span>Time stood, and from his hand the hours, and days,<br
/>
Anon, and years dealt listlessly away;<br />
And, ere a while, she merged on ripened years,<br />
With many honors rising from her path,<br />
Had sons and daughters, and had trained them well,<br />
As it is fitting that a mother should,<br />
And had her mission filled in every way.<br />
Then was her act concluded, and she left<br />
The scenes of life and all the changes there,<br />
And came in gladness to a higher realm,<br />
And there abode together with the just,<br />
Who to their Maker give the glory due,<br />
And who in the affairs of life forget<br />
Not to ascribe Him praise and worship most.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The curtain fell, and, lo! a clear,
strange voice<br />
Broke from the hidden scenes, declaring thus,<br />
And with the words a thrilling power was borne,<br />
That every passer in amazement turned:<br />
&ldquo;Blessed are they who walk in virtue&rsquo;s way!<br />
A maid of virtue is a precious gem,<br />
More priceless than the pearl of many seas.<br />
Her mind is pure as snow which Winter breathes,<br />
White and unspotted with the stains of time.<br />
Her memory is like the gorgeous sun,<br />
Which hath gone down behind the distant hills,<br />
Yet sends a stream of glory from its seat<br />
<!-- page 148--><a name="page148"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
148</span>Upon the firmament where once it rode,<br />
Diffusing there a sweet and golden light.<br />
So shall the recollections of her shine<br />
Upon the hearts of men, who in her time<br />
Did know her worth and the fair fruits thereof.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Scarce had these words been uttered,
when again.<br />
The curtain rose, which hid the stage of life;<br />
And, lo! I saw the like fair scenes were there,<br />
Which in the former act had been displayed;<br />
But she who stood the foremost in the act<br />
Was other maiden, yet as sweet and fair.<br />
Her every limb of beauty was adorned,<br />
And in her face did winning brightness shine.<br />
A manner gay she had, which unto men<br />
Was sweet and charmful, that whoe&rsquo;er beheld<br />
Was at the sight of thrilling rapture filled;<br />
And all her mirth was gay and ever full,<br />
And all her laughter fraught of dancing fun.<br />
A roguish eye she had, from which went forth<br />
Glances askance, to plunder, as they wot,<br />
From simple hearts, which could not turn away<br />
The wily darts which she cast unto them.<br />
Her cheek was bright, and of a rosy hue,<br />
And wondrous was the fashion of her lips,<br />
And they did seem to speak soft tales of love<br />
In every motion which pervaded them.<br />
<!-- page 149--><a name="page149"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
149</span>Which turned to rapture all who gazed thereon,<br />
So deep the passion which they pouted forth.<br />
Her locks were golden, and with braids entwined<br />
In such a magic manner, and they waved<br />
Upon the breezes in a sportive way.<br />
Her raiment was of Fashion&rsquo;s last design,<br />
And so arranged to shew her perfect form<br />
In all the fine proportions it displayed.<br />
Her soft white arms were bared unto the view,<br />
And scarce she needed other charm to hold,<br />
Than did the vesture sideward drawn reveal<br />
Of beauty lying in a tranquil sleep<br />
Upon a pillow of the sweetest form.<br />
And she was proud of graces like to these;<br />
And sadly well she did her beauty know.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Forth from the ranks of town and city
came<br />
A host of pert admirers, to gaze<br />
Upon her sweet and all-bewitching charms,<br />
And cull a little frolic from her hand.<br />
And she was free and open unto all,<br />
And held to each full gaiety and wit,<br />
And on her manner kept no check at all,<br />
And strove to seem more pleasing every hour,<br />
And loved the admiration which they gave.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time stood, and from his hand the hours,
and days,<br />
Anon, and years dealt listlessly away;<br />
<!-- page 150--><a name="page150"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
150</span>And one by one her charms were seen to go;<br />
For every year, as it sped on its course,<br />
Plucked from the flower of purity a leaf,<br />
And from her beauty took the brightest gem,<br />
Until all virtue had been torn away,<br />
And beauty shorn of every single germ.<br />
Thus was her ruin sealed, and day by day<br />
She sank into more hopeless depths of sin,<br />
And was more hardened unto evil ways.<br />
Her form grew haggard and uncouth to see,<br />
And in her eye a dark defiance frowned.<br />
Her soul turned black unto its very core,<br />
And was polluted as a mountain stream<br />
Drugged with the fluid from a bloody war.<br />
Her brow was stamped with hatred and revenge.<br />
Woe and distraction, from these loathsome fonts,<br />
Fierce as hell-torrents, burst upon her path;<br />
And she did spurn repentance.&nbsp; And I saw<br />
The Evil One from depths of darkness come;<br />
And in her way he set a fearful pit,<br />
And death appeared the entrance thereunto.<br />
Then it was opened wider in her way;<br />
I heard an awful shriek, and, lo! beheld<br />
That she was swallowed in its boundless depths.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus was the act concluded, and again<br
/>
The curtain fell upon the stage of life;<br />
<!-- page 151--><a name="page151"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
151</span>And all who saw it trembled at the scene,<br />
And deathlike was the calm which stood around,<br />
And every breath was held for very fear.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then the same voice was heard again
which spoke<br />
Such words of wisdom in the former scene.<br />
And now the curtain was again withdrawn,<br />
And every form had vanished from the view,<br />
Save he who spake and hoary-headed Time;<br />
And Time still stood and dealt the hours away.<br />
And over all a mighty change had come;<br />
Old things had gone, and others held their place;<br />
And he who was the speaker stood upright,<br />
And was adorned with raiment pure and white.<br />
He stood surrounded by a dazzling light;<br />
More bright his presence was than gorgeous suns,<br />
Whereas he had an eye of wondrous power.<br />
Imposing was his presence to behold,<br />
And these the words in stirring force he spake:<br />
&ldquo;Pause, all ye young, ye thoughtless ones who run<br />
In wild delight among the gay-borne paths,<br />
Which pleasure spreads enticingly around.<br />
O youth deluded! dwell not in the thought<br />
That they shall prosper for eternal years.<br />
Truth is profound, and this more deep than all&mdash;<br />
That beauty is but like a passing charm,<br />
And youth a landmark by the way of Time&mdash;<br />
<!-- page 152--><a name="page152"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
152</span>A stage which soon his chariot rolls by,<br />
And leaves in dark obscurity behind,<br />
As it drives on to the eternal gates.<br />
Then pause, and be not blinded by the show<br />
Of such an idle vanity.&nbsp; Ye know<br />
An end awaits the sojourn here below.&rdquo;<br />
These were his warnings.&nbsp; Then methought I saw,<br />
One on each hand, the two eternal gates;<br />
Whereto he turned, and, opening one, disclosed<br />
Realms of most wondrous beauty, and therein<br />
Were beings of a loveliness untold;<br />
And all around appeared to give them joy,<br />
And in their midst dwelt unity and love,<br />
And they were clothed in raiments purely grand,<br />
With diadems of honor on their brows;<br />
And sweet the music was which hovered round,<br />
And this appeared an everlasting feast.<br />
Then he did close, without a word or sign,<br />
This gate, and to the other mutely went,<br />
And, opening which, disclos&eacute;d to the view<br />
Such ghastly scenes of torture, and therein<br />
Were creatures seething in eternal flame;<br />
And loathsome was their presence to behold,<br />
And woe and agony were ever in their midst,<br />
And bitter were the strifes, in which they bore<br />
An angry hate to other wretches doomed<br />
<!-- page 153--><a name="page153"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
153</span>Alike with them to welter in its toil.<br />
These were the scenes.&nbsp; Then, mutely as before,<br />
He closed the gate, and vanished from the view.<br />
And every gazer stood in wonder bound,<br />
Until upon the distance came the sound<br />
Of chariots and horsemen; and, erewhile,<br />
Came rolling up the chariots of Time<br />
In quick succession; and I saw therein,<br />
Beings conveyed to the eternal gates;<br />
Some unto that o&rsquo;er which these golden words<br />
Were traced in figures ever bold and bright:<br />
&ldquo;Enter, ye blessed, to eternal joy;&rdquo;<br />
And others unto that o&rsquo;er which I saw,<br />
&ldquo;Enter, ye cursed, to eternal doom.&rdquo;<br />
Then fell the curtain on the scene, and, lo!<br />
I woke from slumber, and it was a dream.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thus dawned a glorious day.</p>
<p>A stilly calm prevailed to rest<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the surrounding scene;<br />
Scarce could upon the ocean&rsquo;s breast<br />

<p>The soft, fresh air of Summer morn<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stood peacefully around,<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view of Leith were found.</p>
<p>I rose in haste to hail the sight<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of Scotland&rsquo;s lovely shore,<br />
Which to my mind brought fancies bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And thoughts of days of yore.</p>

Defiance from its rocky rood<br />

<p>I thought, had it the power to speak,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What stories could it tell;<br />
What deeds of darkness could it break,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Or mysteries dispel.</p>
<p>Around its seat, in hidden gore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Foul deeds of vengeance sleep,<br />
Which caus&eacute;d orphans to implore,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And widows oft to weep.</p>
<p>And now, in close succession, see<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The smoky ringlets rise,<br />
From many a chimney-top set free,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ascending to the skies.</p>
<p>Then comes there to salute the ear<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faint fragments of a sound;<br />
And mingled noises soon I hear,&mdash;<br />

Illuminate and cheer each lonely day,<br />
Restore a peace, afford a tranquil rest,<br />
Create a joy in your oft troubled breast;<br />

May dreams of happy hours thy spirit cheer&mdash;<br />
Fond dreams of they who to thy heart are dear.<br />
But tell me, love, what is the lingering thought<br />
Which seeks a presence, from the distance brought,<br />
Far, far away, and which, with pleasing spells,<br />
Doth mingle here and there a word which tells&mdash;<br />
Oh sadly true!&mdash;that ye shall meet no more<br />
The one you love?&nbsp; These thoughts are very sore;<br />
The spirit sinks in grief and sadness low,<br />
And thrilling shudders through the being flow.<br />

<p>The day had passed as other days do pass,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With record made of all the deeds<br />
Performed by one, or two, or a whole mass,&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It matters not, for all concedes.</p>
<p>The sun in turn had lit the eastern sky,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Performed his circuit to the west,<br />
Diffusing light and heat below and high,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And there had sunk his golden crest.</p>
<p>Monotony had likewise marked my course&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By that I mean that nothing rare<br />
Had happen&eacute;d at all, to cause recourse<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To friendly joy or cold despair.</p>
<p>A pleasant ramble by the ocean side&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; May be it was the company<br />
That added joy when I did watch the tide<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Roll on the shore of the great sea.</p>
<p><!-- page 163--><a name="page163"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
163</span>This o&rsquo;er, thought turned to urge a night&rsquo;s
repose&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An old, though ever new,
retreat&mdash;<br />
To rest the weary body, and to close<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mind awhile in tranquils sweet.</p>
<p>But, prior to this, I thought it might be well<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To store some food into the mind,<br />
And on the wonders of the day to dwell,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There fitting nourishment to find.</p>
<p>The comic thoughts of famous &ldquo;Punch&rdquo; were read,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then something dry, but suited more<br
/>
As wholesome food&mdash;so some old fogies said&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The Daily News,&rdquo; let none
deplore.</p>
<p>For comfort&rsquo;s sake&mdash;which people always mind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Excepting ladies, when the book<br />
Of modes another pleasing style can find,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then they think more how they
look.</p>
<p>An instance take of chignon (dead folk&rsquo;s hair)&mdash;<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A lady, I know well, remarked,<br />
&ldquo;I wish I was not forced those things to wear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But fashion must be always
marked.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 164--><a name="page164"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
164</span>Again I say, for comfort&rsquo;s sake alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The couch I sought, and thought it
best<br />
Awhile to rest my weary body on;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The weary always seek for rest.</p>
<p>The chronicle of news a time was used,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first with understanding clear;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (A mixture there for any seer.)</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Away into the land of Nod;<br />

<p>Wrapt in those fairy dreams of pleasant lands,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A gentle pressure on my lips,<br />
Of softest touch, like that of fairy hands,<br />

Nothing to cheer his wee heart to joy,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All melancholy dreary.<br />
For his heart is heavy, and he sobs;<br />

Each heart of joy must brimful teem,<br />
And thus send forth a cheering beam.</p>
<p>The gloomy clouds have passed away,<br />
And bright and glorious is the day;<br />
The sun gives forth a genial ray,<br />
And gentle breezes music play.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis strange&mdash;but no more strange than

That cloudy weather can construe<br />
Unto our thoughts a gloomy view,<br />
That all things seem of dismal hue.</p>
<p>But with a clear, transparent sky,<br />
All gloomy thoughts as quickly fly,<br />
And bright and happy ones supply<br />
Their place, and raise our spirits high.</p>

Pour on this wounded heart thy healing balm,<br />
Prepared to soothe, and troubled spirits calm.<br />
E&rsquo;er since the time that on this mouldy ball<br />
Man held a place, and that before the fall,<br />
The youthful world was held in no reserve;<br />
For thy enchanting strains did pleasure serve<br />
The young creation, and they hailed the sound.<br />
But then the Author&rsquo;s work did all rebound<br />
With perfect mirth, and music in it all,<br />
Till evil spirits caus&eacute;d man to fall.<br />
But when the fruit was tasted and thought good,<br />
First by the woman, then the man, as food,<br />
Though the condition was at first so placed,<br />
That they might use or all the produce taste<br />
Of the fair garden, save alone one tree,<br />
Which in the centre stood, and there to be<br />
Untouched; but, notwithstanding these commands,<br />
The rosy fruit looked tempting in Eve&rsquo;s hands,<br />
Where it was by the cunning serpent placed.<br />

When in the book of record was inscribed<br />
This scene so sad, as man to evil bribed,<br />
Music still came, but with it came alloy,<br />
For sounds of sadness came with sounds of joy.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At first the music was but
nature&rsquo;s own;<br />
Yet who will not in ready justice own<br />
That nature&rsquo;s notes in beauty far excel<br />
All sounds that art&rsquo;s production can impel?<br />
Who this can question, if they lend an ear<br />
Unto the lark that, pouring music clear,<br />
Makes all the sphere for many miles around<br />
With his gay song re-echo and resound;<br />
Or, pausing, marks the sweet, melodious lay<br />
The nightingale at stilly night doth lay;<br />
Or listens to the morn or evening praise,<br />
As the wild warblers blended chorus raise,<br />
The hum of bee, as duty it fulfils,<br />
The rippling stream that sports among the hills,<br />
The constant murmur of the mighty seas,<br />
Or pensive sighing of the Summer breeze,<br />
Which, rambling, rustles through the leafy trees,<br />
The choice of favor it may well command?<br />
Yet art&rsquo;s production may in honor stand,<br />

Who doth not love to hear the Sabbath bells?<br />
Or who attend, without an inward sigh,<br />
The gentle song which maidens&rsquo; lips supply,<br />
While on the harp with skilful touch is played<br />
Responsive song, in harmony conveyed?<br />
Or who can hear the noble martial strain,<br />
And not be moved to long the sounds again?<br />
The deep, grand notes of noble organ who<br />
Can mutely tend, as they go thrilling through,<br />
From aisle to aisle of some cathedral old,<br />
And, rising, still their richer sounds unfold?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The love of music in the bud appears<br

First in the child of sweet and early years;<br />
Then in the youth its early leaves unfold;<br />
The fruit it bears in manhood&rsquo;s time behold;<br />
Until the Autumn comes, old age enthrals,<br />
Decay sets in, and then the leaflet falls.</p>

Whereof to learn we shudder, in the thought<br />
That they passed from us as a worthless thing,<br />
While all our heed to idleness was lent.<br />

Review the acts performed, and see<br />
How they will bear the scrutiny ye give.<br />
How do the deeds of ill<br />
Throng round the retrospective glance!<br />
While few and feeble are the acts of truth.<br />
Where is the profit we have gained?<br />
Or where the good a brother took from us?<br />
Let us not spurn the many warnings shewn.<br />

Another came; which in the old seat sits, whereof<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the morning light.</p>
<p>She marked each feebly passing breath<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And every burdened sigh;<br />
Nor grew she weary of the task;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No sleep came to her nigh.</p>
<p>She kissed his cheek, his pillow smoothed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His burning brow she bathed;<br />
And with a balmy fillet oft<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His aching temples swathed.</p>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her brooding thoughts would pry;<br />
She could not think that he must soon&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he must truly die.</p>
<p>And yet she saw the ruddy hue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pass from his cheek away,<br />
And that the lustre of his eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grew fainter every day.</p>
<p>At last a gentle sleep he slept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And hope came in her breast,<br />
As she beheld the tranquil smiles<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which on his features rest.</p>
<p>She sat and sighed, &ldquo;Ah me! ah me!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh for the time again<br />
When I shall see thy happy smile<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its wonted mirth regain!</p>
<p>Then shall we, as in time before,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The tranquil hours employ<br />
In love and in a measure full<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of unpolluted joy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><!-- page 193--><a name="page193"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
193</span>Oh, child of hope!&nbsp; She knew not then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That he who by her lay<br />
Was closed in death&rsquo;s unyielding arms,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His spirit borne away.</p>
<p>And when she turned from these fair dreams,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And saw he breathed no more,<br />
Oh! woeful was it to behold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The grief the maiden bore.</p>
<p>She grasped the pale and lifeless form;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tears fell on it fast;<br />
She sat the long night through and wept,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wept the noonday past.</p>
<p>No more she cares for earthly things,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nor friendly presence nigh;<br />
These gladly now would leave behind,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now would gladly die.</p>
<p>Dear mourner, is there nought to calm&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To soothe thy troubled breast?<br />
Is there no balm to heal its wounds,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And give thy spirit rest?</p>
<p><!-- page 194--><a name="page194"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
194</span>Yes! there is one&mdash;a fragrant balm,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A fountain filled with love,<br />
Which floweth ever full and free<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the bright realms above.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis there the weary and the sad<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Can comforts true receive,<br />
And there the bleeding heart alone<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its anguish can relieve.</p>
<p>Oh! brightly yet the star of hope<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sends forth its radiant beams,<br />
And sweetly yet the voice of love<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In friendly welcome gleams.</p>
<p>Then raise thy tear-bedimm&eacute;d eyes,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And call its bounty down;<br />
Which, if in faith ye seek, will flow,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And all thy sorrows drown.</p>

<p>Farewell! farewell! a sad farewell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My soul can only give.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And can it
be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That I may
see<br />
Thy cherished face no more,&mdash;<br />
See it again no more?</p>
<p>I cannot tell, I must not tell<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The sorrow that is mine;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But while
I live<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yet will I
give<br />
A lingering thought to thee,<br />
A happy thought to thee.</p>
<p>And to those days, those happy days,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I often will recur,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Which we
have spent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On
pleasures bent,<br />
Together bound by peaceful joy&mdash;<br />
A fair, a pure, a loving joy.<br />

Farewell! farewell!</p>

<p>I lost myself in labyrinths of unexplored delight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In wandering from the paths of sterner
truth;<br />
They seemed, beyond a doubt, all pleasing, fair, serene, and
bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Such as would charm the wonder of a
youth.</p>
<p>Behind, before, and all around, appearing to the eye<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As one concerted scene of peaceful
joy,<br />
With pleasing streams of unpolluted pleasure flowing by,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And in it all I saw no base alloy.</p>
<p>The scope was boundless, and I wandered, still admiring
all,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indulging oft in free, unfettered
thought;<br />
In wonder wrapt, I wandered on, but found no rest withal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As each new scene was to my fancy
brought.</p>
<p><!-- page 197--><a name="page197"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
197</span>And in the future I could see with an imagining eye<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A cheering prospect, rising pure and
bright.<br />
It seemed my future path in smooth, unchequered ways did lie,<br
/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That cares were easy and life&rsquo;s
burdens light.</p>
<p>Amid the tranquils sweet around, and to my own design,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I built me castles of a towering
height,<br />
And thereto did my pleasures and my rising hopes resign,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thought that these bulwarks would resist
all might.</p>
<p>But, lo! they fell in ruined heaps, and mighty was the
fall,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And my bright hopes lay ruined at my
feet,<br />
And the deluding dream of fancy passed away, and all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The scenes so fair did from me now
retreat;</p>
<p>Like as the mirage travellers see upon the desert waste,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In view where cooling waters seem to
rise,<br />
And which the body longs to reach, the parch&eacute;d tongue to
taste&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Alas! alas! such fancy is not wise.</p>

<p>Well do I love to ramble<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Among the golden heath,<br />
To roam, and rove, and scramble<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the soft turf beneath.</p>
<p>&rsquo;Tis there that health is ever<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Abounding to be found,<br />
And beauty faileth never<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In full charms to abound.</p>
<p>I pity oft and sorrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the poor city child,<br />
That ne&rsquo;er the chance can borrow<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To ramble free and wild;</p>
<p>It looks so pale and feeble,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its cheek is thin and white,<br />
Its sicknesses are treble,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Its joys are never bright.</p>

Ha! well thou fliest from the light,<br />
To lie in secret and repose,<br />
Hid in some crevice no one knows;<br />
And, wrapt in slumber&rsquo;s lightest sleep,<br />
Thy ears their vigils ever keep,<br />
Lest some stray wanderer may intrude,<br />
To mar thy sacred solitude.<br />
Thy pinions only bear thee out<br />
To search for plunder and to scout<br />
For prey, in soft and noiseless flight,<br />
When earth lies in repose, and night<br />
Has drawn her curtain o&rsquo;er the sky.<br />
&rsquo;Tis then, &rsquo;tis then thy tender eye<br />
Is keen to see, reviewing all<br />
Which under its quick glance may fall.</p>

<p>A maiden came to Castletown;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tear stood in her eye;<br />
Soon on her cheek it trickled down;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sore did the maiden cry.</p>
<p>I called her to my side, and said,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, maiden, do you
cry?&rdquo;<br />
A while her weeping then was stayed,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But she made no reply.</p>
<p>I spoke to her, in kindly tones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of friendship and of love;<br />
I asked about her lov&eacute;d ones,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And where she meant to rove.</p>
<p>She, with a voice in sadness lost,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And choked with many a sigh,<br />
Said that her father&rsquo;s form was toss&rsquo;d<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Beneath the billows high.</p>
<p><!-- page 202--><a name="page202"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
202</span>Her mother had for many years<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Been silent in the grave;<br />
Her brother, too, she told in tears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Was killed&mdash;a soldier brave.</p>
<p>And now her father&rsquo;s friends withheld<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The friendship once they gave;<br />
And she, an orphan lone, beheld<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No succour but the grave.</p>
<p>She then besought some menial form<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of duty to fulfil,<br />
And gladly would the child conform<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To many a trying ill.</p>
<p>I said, &ldquo;Dear maiden, come with me;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My home shall too be thine,<br />
And with my daughters ye shall be<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another child of mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then she wept for very joy;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her tongue would not convey<br />
The words she sought it to employ<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What thanks she longed to say.</p>
<p><!-- page 203--><a name="page203"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
203</span>And with, a trembling step she came,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And, ere a little while,<br />
Her joys returned, of old the same,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And came her olden smile.</p>
<p>And she by all was fondly loved;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was so good and kind,<br />
And gentle in her way, and proved<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A charm of charms combined.</p>
<p>Years rolled away, eight happy years,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Since the memorial day;<br />
Then in the town gay joy appears,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And merry minstrels play.</p>
<p>And loudly peal the merry bells;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is her wedding-day;<br />
It is my son who gladly tells<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;I will,&rdquo; I love to say.</p>
<h2><!-- page 204--><a name="page204"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 204</span>THE AIM OF LIFE.</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mark well, and do not pass in
heedless haste,<br />
Nor all your time in needless folly waste;<br />
But, if with you a solemn thought doth dwell,<br />
Pray lend it here, and think it may be well<br />
Awhile to set aside the world&rsquo;s stern care,<br />
And for a true, though passing, glance prepare<br />
Upon a theme which is too often hid<br />
By pleasure&rsquo;s streams and vanities which thread<br />
The onward path which through the wide world wends,<br />
Which chequered is, and many a snare attends.<br />
The theme I speak of is the aim of life.<br />
Who fails to see, amid the passing strife<br />
Where man appears, and in a season dies,<br />
Forgotten soon in mouldering dust he lies,<br />
That he has strayed from the good purpose far,<br />
That all his joys are vain, and such as mar<br />
His hope to an unmitigated peace.<br />
The bonds grow stronger, and his lusts increase<br />
The while his chances are for ever lost,<br />
And he is now before the tempest toss&rsquo;d.<br />
A thoughtful mind in question thus may dwell;<br />
<!-- page 205--><a name="page205"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
205</span>And who is found an answer fit to tell?<br />
When man was formed, what aim was held in view<br />
By the Creator, ever just and true,<br />
Who all things made but for a purpose wise?<br />
Behold, his work an ample proof supplies<br />
What feelings stirred His breast when man was made,<br />
And all creation to him subject laid.<br />
Discretion lent to shew the ill from good,<br />
Portrayed in him the Maker&rsquo;s image stood;<br />
Nor was it meant that he should time employ<br />
In foolish pleasure and licentious joy,<br />
Less far that self should be his only theme;<br />
A fallen state soon had he to redeem.<br />
More thus the purpose, and the Maker&rsquo;s law<br />
Held it as good, and man the duty saw&mdash;<br />
That God, the Maker, should true worship have,<br />
And reverence and love; and, as to prove<br />
Obeyance, it was held that he should love<br />
His neighbour as himself.&nbsp; This from above<br />
Bestowed, and from conditions free, save one,<br />
And which was sweet and pleasing to be done<br />
In the true spirit of a perfect life,<br />
Where no fear came, or jealousy, or strife&mdash;<br />
No earthly thing should have the honor due<br />
Unto the Maker; yet how sadly few<br />
Can say they have endeavoured to be true!</p>

<p>But by a meadow green&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A meadow sweet and fair,<br />
In beauty it was seen;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I saw the primrose there.</p>
<p>It sported with the breeze,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It courted with the sun,<br />
And tried so hard to please<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With all its puny fun.</p>
<p>It flirted with the moon,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And kissed the early dew;<br />
They left it both ere noon;<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Came wandering by the way;<br />
It came to have a look,<br />

<p>It gave it drink so sweet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And sang a pretty song;<br />
The brook seemed to entreat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be the lover long.</p>
<p>A sturdy old oak tree<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bent o&rsquo;er it night and day,<br />
Its guardian feigned to be,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And shelter it alway.</p>
<p>In time some courtiers took<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Their turn to have a woo.<br />
I came to take a look,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And was a lover too.</p>
<p>I took the pretty flower,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And set it in my breast,<br />
Rejoicing in that hour,<br />

<p>Lest gossip wakes, be mute, breathe not a word<br />
Of how, or where, or when, save that we met;<br />
To chance, or luck, or fortune bid the fault,<br />
Till ye can tell how else our friendship came.<br />
Improved occasions are not often rued,<br />
Except discretion fails in self-command.</p>
<p>As brief a while as may a friendship live<br />
No one can tell, so soon it dies, or how,<br />
Now as it came, and as a seed expands,<br />
In nurture soon springs up; so sprang, matured<br />
Each time the more a favor in regard.</p>
<p>As first of chance, unsought till then, but now<br />
Let favor choose if she may hold the power<br />
Drawn from the font of pleasure to supply<br />
Enticing sweets, which, though you took, rebelled.<br />
Reigned o&rsquo;er the scene the silvery moon, which smiled,<br
/>
Together with the stars, in silent joy.<br />
Of that she deemed no harm, was sweetly pleased!<br />
Neptune breathed silence and supplied the chance.</p>

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
